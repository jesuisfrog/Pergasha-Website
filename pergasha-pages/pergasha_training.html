As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to create an invisible, psychic anchor in a shadowed space that you can see within 60 feet of you. This anchor remains for up to 1 hour. It dissipates if there are no shadows over it, you are incapacitated, you summon another anchor, or you dismiss it with a free action. While the anchor is active and within 120 feet of you, you can use a bonus action and 1 ki point to jump your mind, spirit and body to it. You teleport to that location so long as it is unoccupied, and you can fit. If you cannot, the ability does not activate and you do not expend the ki, but the bonus action is lost.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can bring a willing creature you touch with you for 1 additional ki point per creature (maximum 2). The creature(s) must be able to fit in the area adjacent to the anchor. If any creature cannot fit, the ability does not activate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anchor is invisible to normal vision, but it does exude an aura for those that look for them. The aura mimics your own and is as unique as a fingerprint.</li><li  class="internal-list"><b>Ki Spear.</b> You use your spiritual and psychic energy to shape your own blood into a spear. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point and take 1 damage to hurl your ki-infused blood-spear at a foe in a burst of telekinetic power. You aim your spear at a creature within 30 feet of you and perform a ranged attack. On a hit, you deal 1d8 piercing damage and the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a fail, the spear leaves a hole in the target and it gains the Bleed property. The damage of this ability increases to 2d8 at 10th level.</li><li  class="internal-list"><b>Ki Whip.</b> You can spend 2 ki points as an action to create a whip of telekinetic energy that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. A creature that you can see that is within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 force damage, plus an extra 1d8 force damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you canpull a creature up to one size category larger than yourself up to 10 feet closer to you. If extra ki points were spent on this ability, you can pull the creature an extra 5 feet (25 feet max). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you do not pull it.</li></ul></p></div>

Your mount shares your initiative. While mounted, you use its movement speed in place of your own, and you can comfortably attack with ranged or melee weapons while mounted and moving. In addition, you gain the following benefits:<ul class="pr-4 pb-4"><li  class="internal-list"><b>Quick Mount. </b>Mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement rather than half your speed.</li><li  class="internal-list"><b>One with the Saddle. </b>You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you’re not incapacitated. If the fall is greater than 10 feet, you have advantage on any saving throws or skill checks made to avoid falling prone, but you will still take falling damage.</li><li  class="internal-list"><b>Mounted Defender. </b>You can fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you’re wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack’s damage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</li><li  class="internal-list"><b>Mounted Strike. </b>When you are riding upon a creature capable of movement at a speed 40 feet or faster, you can use the momentum of your mount to deal one powerful strike at a target that is not prone or smaller than you. If the weapon also has reach, the prone condition or size difference doesn’t prevent your mounted strike.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must command your mount to Dash in a straight line through the position of your target. When you enter reach, you can spend one of your attacks to make a special melee attack. If it hits, the target suffers susceptibility (1d10) to the attack damage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can then continue the movement of your mount and you do not provoke an opportunity attack if you leave the reach of your target unless your special melee attack missed.</li></ul></p></div>
