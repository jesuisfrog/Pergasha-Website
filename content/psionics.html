                                the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to
                                grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.<br>If some solid
                                object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and
                                creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object
                                or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there,
                                oscillating slightly, for the duration.<br>At the end of the duration, affected
                                objects and creatures fall back down. You gain one level of exhaustion.</li>

                                <strong>Act of Service: </strong>This act cannot cause bodily harm or death to the
                                creature. Acts are usually conditional, such as, “Always offer
                                hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay.” Alternatively, the act
                                can be more generalized or framed in a way that doesn’t require the target to perform
                                that act exclusively, though it must prioritize the
                                task above all leisurely pursuits.<br>
                                On a failed save, the sculpt takes hold and remains in place for 1
                                day. Each day thereafter, the creature makes a saving throw to free
                                themselves of the sculpt; this saving throw cannot be enhanced in
                                any way. Once the creature frees themselves, they are aware of
                                your influence, but you do not suffer any negative effects.<br>
                                If the target is unable or fights performing the act, it gains 1 level of
                                exhaustion, and the exhaustion increases by 1 level for each
                                consecutive day it is prevented from performing or fights the act, up
                                to a maximum of 4. These levels of exhaustion are immediately
                                removed when it follows the sculpt again or the sculpt is lifted; it
                                cannot remove exhaustion gained from this ability in any other way.
                                Only an Inquisitor can repair a mind affected in this manner.<br>
                                <strong>Heightened:</strong> You can spend 1 Inspiration Point to increase the
                                duration to 1 month or 3 Inspiration Points to increase the duration to
                                1 year.<br><br>
                                <strong>Alter: </strong>You can affect the target's memory of an event that it
                                experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10
                                minutes. On a failed save, you can permanently eliminate all
                                memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with
                                perfect clarity and exacting detail, or change its memory of the
                                details of the event.<br>
                                You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are
                                affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the
                                modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details
                                of your description. If the evoking time ends before you have finished
                                describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't
                                altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the
                                evoking time ends.<br>
                                A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature
                                behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's
                                natural inclinations or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as
                                implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing
                                itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might
                                deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a
                                significant manner.<br><br>
                                <strong>Create: </strong>This works similarly to Alter but you are not tied to a
                                specific
                                window of time, and you can create a memory rather than adjust
                                one. You must still obey the memory duration.

                                the number rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or
                                ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one
                                of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll,
                                and a roll can be replaced in this way only once per turn. When you
                                finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.<br>
                                In addition, your dreams are busy with visions of different times and
                                places. The GM can use dreams to grant interesting or important
                                information a Seer. Also, once per session, you can seek out
                                guidance or answer to a specific question. To do so, frame your
                                question and perform a blind Wisdom (Psionics) skill check against a
                                DC determined by the GM. On a success and depending on the
                                nature of the question, the GM will provide an answer that may
                                come in the form of visions, a riddle, or a simple response. On a
                                failure, you will receive empty mists or the GM may decide to grant
                                some manner of vision. Critical failures may result in false information.</li>

                            <li>As an action, you create a psychic sensor within 60 feet of you. The
                                sensor lasts until your concentration ends. You can spend 1 psi to
                                increase the duration of this ability by 1 hour for each psi spent
                                beyond the base cost. This sensor is invisible but has a trace of your
                                aura and hovers in the air, has 1 hit point, and is immune to all
                                damage except for psychic and force damage.<br><br>
                                You lose your own sight and instead see through this sensor that has
                                normal and darkvision with a range of 60 feet. While you use this
                                ability, you can spend an action to switch between seeing through
                                your own eyes and the sensor. You have no other sensory
                                information through the sensor, but your body retains its other senses
                                for your physical location. The sensor can look in all directions and as
                                an action, you can move the sensor up to 30 feet in any direction.
                                There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it
                                can’t enter another plane of existence or go through a teleportation
                                gateway. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but the eye
                                can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter. You
                                cannot use abilities through the sensor.<br><br>
                                <strong>Heightened:</strong> You can use an Inspiration Point to make the sensor
                                pass through solid objects harmlessly for the duration.

                                When you succeed in using this ability, you create an invisible sensor
                                made of a fragment of your aura in the location or within 10 feet of
                                the creature or object. You can see through the sensor as if you
                                were there, using your own vision capabilities. Creatures capable of
                                seeing auras see the sensor as a luminous tiny orb.<br>
                                All Seers can use this ability to seek out familiar places, people, and
                                objects, but each Seer’s technique, method, and focus is unique.

                                you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your
                                familiarity with the destination modifies the difficulty.

                            most recently revived psions, and while they
                            are generally well-loved, they have also created a burgeoning
                            paranoia. Their ability to attune to anchors and then transport
                            themselves and others to these anchors make travel that once was
                            painstakingly long and dangerous fluid and safe. However, with this
                            luxury came those that sought to exploit and take advantage of the
                            lack of security against such powers. After a period of chaos and
                            thievery, a semblance of order was attained after the guilty travelers
                            had their abilities stunted or controlled by Inquisitors. Now, people
                            are often barred from entry or seeing inside important locations until
                            they have been thoroughly vetted or questioned. Thus, few travelers
                            have since made themselves publicly known, and those exhibiting
                            any teleportation abilities are watched carefully.</span></span>

                            <li>You use a fragment of your aura to create an invisible, intangible
                                teleportation anchor. This anchor bears your unique aural signature
                                and requires 10 minutes of focus while touching a 10x10 solid, flat
                                surface to take hold. You can create a number of anchors equal to
                                your proficiency bonus. Once an anchor takes hold, it no longer
                                requires the original surface to exist. If the surface is destroyed, the
                                anchor is locked in place and suspended in the air.<br><br>
                                Anchors are visible to creatures with the ability to see auras, and
                                these creatures can attempt to destroy an anchor by spending 10
                                minutes and performing a Psionics (Intelligence) check. The DC to
                                destroy an anchor is the Traveler’s Psionic DC. On a failure, the
                                anchor remains and the creature takes 2 levels of fatigue. On a
                                success, the anchor is destroyed and the creature takes 1 level of
                                fatigue. You are always aware of the state of your anchors.
                                <br><br>
                                You can convert one anchor into a home anchor by spending a full
                                rest in the location. A home anchor cannot be destroyed and is
                                immobile. You can only ever have one home anchor. If you create
                                another home anchor, the existing one converts to a basic anchor.
                                <br><br>
                                A Traveler can see any anchor and knowing an individual and their
                                aura can help identify the owner. A Traveler can only use their own
                                anchors.<br><br>
                                Additionally, whenever you use any psionic discipline to teleport, you
                                can instead teleport to an anchor even if you can’t see it, but it must
                                be within range of the teleportation ability.

                                throw, you deal twice the damage. The target is also buried up to its waist (or half
                                its body) in the ground. Its movement is reduced to zero, and it must spend its
                                action to make a Strength (Athletics) check (DC=15) to get out of the ground. It is
                                considered prone for the purposes of attacks.<br> This ability will not work on

                                can see. All creatures in a 10-foot radius of that space must make a

                                quicksand. The area of quicksand is difficult terrain, requires a
                                Perception check to notice it (DC=14), remains for a number of turns
                                equal to your level.

                                make a Strength saving throw or be caught. Creatures can be
                                assisted with rope or other abilities to gain advantage on their saves.
                                The longer a creature is trapped, the more dire their circumstances.

                                Creatures caught in the quicksand has their movement speed
                                reduced to 0. At the start of each of their turns, creatures must make
                                a Strength saving throw or continue to sink. If a creature falls
                                unconscious in the quicksand, it automatically begins to sink and
                                suffocate. After a successful save, a creature regains their
                                movement speed.
