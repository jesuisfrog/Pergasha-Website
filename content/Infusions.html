        <p class="mb-2 text-left">Aerofusion allows control over air and, by extension, wind. Air motes are constantly
          moving and while the untrained eye may see them as agents of chaos, they are quite the opposite. They are a
          conundrum: logical yet flighty; predictably dynamic; heavy and light. This affinity lends grace and speed to
          fusists while also an ability to pull back from a heated moment and analyze a situation dispassionately..</p>
        <p class="text-left">When you select Aerofusion, you gain the following passive ability in addition to the first
          tier of Windweaving.
        <ul class="mb-5 text-left">
          <li><strong>Infused Movement:</strong> Your steps are quick and quiet. You gain proficiency in Stealth (or
            gain expertise if you already have proficiency), and your movement speed increases by 5 feet. If you have a
            flying speed, it increases by 10 feet.</li>

                you can use the Windwhip ability.</p>

                  cannot activate this ability if you are encumbered. After moving, you fall to the ground, ignoring the
                  first 30 feet of falling damage.<br><br> If you use this airburst while flying, levitating, or
                  hovering, you are not forced to fall so long as you can maintain your height otherwise. Airburst can

                    As part of movement, a creature you touch (including yourself) can travel vertically up to 20 feet
                    each turn for the
                    duration. If the target stops in the air, it can opt to fall to the ground. If it stays aloft, it
                    has disadvantage on
                    Dexterity ability checks (unless the target is an Aerofusist or a flying creature). The creature
                    immediately falls if
                    you lose concentration, or it falls unconscious.

                    If the target is a flying creature, it gains 20 feet to its flying speed.

                    The target can instead walk
                    on air as if it were solid ground for the duration. It can ascend and descend in this way at a
                    maximum of a 45-degree
                    angle. It suffers disadvantage on Dexterity ability checks if it ends its movement

                <li><b>Range: </b>100 feet</li>

                <li>
                  <p>You churn up a violent windstorm centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 50
                    feet. Thunder booms, winds roar and flying debris turn deadly. Upon creating the storm and at the
                    start of each of your turns while you maintain concentration, each creature in the storm must make a
                    Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 slashing damage from the debris,
                    is blinded, and is deafened for 5 minutes. A creature can wear eye protection to avoid blindness,
                    but a creature already blinded cannot recover until the end of their next turn after protecting
                    their eyes. An Aerofusist will not be blinded or deafened while in the storm, but they can be
                    damaged by the debris.</p>
                  <p>All flying creatures in the area immediately descend 40 feet. The entire area is difficult terrain
                    for all creatures except those that burrow. Any creature that ends its turn flying within the area
                    descends 20 feet, and any creature pushed into a surface by this ability’s winds or some other means
                    takes bludgeoning damage as though it had fallen.</p>
                  <p>Ranged or thrown weapons and smaller projectiles cannot be used effectively in the storm or
                    targeting creatures within the storm. However, massive projectiles (such as a boulder) can be used.
                  </p>
                  <p>A creature attempting to leave the storm must use an action to succeed at an Athletics check or
                    Acrobatics check against your spell DC to get through. A creature that fails is trapped within but
                    can try again.</p>
                  <p>To maintain concentration on this ability, you must expend 1 Hit Die at the start of each of your
                    turns. If you do not have Hit Die to expend, the storm immediately dies.</p>
                  <p><b>Synergy</b>: Using infusions targeting an area within the storm or while a fusist is in the
                    storm itself while using abilities causes a variety of effects. The infusion must have a minimum
                    cost of 1 mana or Hit Die. Using an ability with a concentration effect that has no minimum cost
                    will not trigger a synergy, but initially activating an ability with a cost will.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Bloodfusion creates a sickening rain to fall in the storm. Each creature in the storm takes 1d6

                    <li>Hydrofusion creates a flurry of hailstones. Each creature in the storm takes 2d6 bludgeoning

                      struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 lightning damage and
                      2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>

                  <p>Powerful winds coalesce to cause destruction in an area within 30 feet of you. You can trigger this
                    ability only if you are outside or the ceiling is 80 feet or higher. The whirlwind is a cylinder
                    that is 70 feet high with a radius of 20 feet. The area of the whirlwind is difficult terrain.</p>
                  <p>All creatures in the area must make a Dexterity save or take 5d10 bludgeoning damage as powerful
                    winds and debris buffet them. Flying creatures have disadvantage on this save unless they are
                    Aerofusists.</p>
                  <p>Each turn you maintain concentration, you may move the whirlwind up to 15 feet in a straight line.
                    Each creature the whirlwind moves through must make a Dexterity save. A creature can be affected by
                    a whirlwind only once per turn.

                  <p>You create a barrier of gusting winds that hinders anything moving through it. The wall of swirling
                    winds is 5 feet thick, 60 feet long, and 30 feet high. The wall stands vertically, but you can shape
                    its path. Though the wall of wind distorts the air, it does not hamper sight. The wall has the
                    following effects.</p>
                  <p>Ammunition from physical ranged attacks—such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets, and other objects of
                    similar size—can't pass through the wall. Attacks with bigger ranged weapons, such as javelins, have
                    advantage on attack rolls if their paths pass through the wall. Massive ranged weapons and effects
                    that don't create physical objects pass through the wall with no penalty.</p>
                  <p>The wall is difficult terrain to creatures attempting to move overland through it. Gases can't pass
                    through the wall. A creature that attempts to fly through the wall must succeed on a Strength save
                    to do so. Hovering or levitating creatures are instantly pushed out of the wall in a random
                    direction and cannot pass

                    wall into a barrier of wind blades. Alternatively, you can use another bonus action in a different
                    turn and pay 1 mana to empower the ward. A burst of blades reaches out 5 feet from the wall and all
                    creatures within 10 feet must make a Dexterity save or take 3d6 slashing damage. Then, any creatures
                    beginning their turn or passing through the wall take 1d6 slashing damage. At will, you can remove
                    the blades while still maintaining the ward, but you must spend 1 mana and use a bonus action to
                    reactivate.

                  <p>You also create a layer of ice on all surfaces in the area, which become difficult terrain for
                    anyone that is not an Aerofusist. Unattended objects in the area become slick with ice, and picking
                    them up requires a successful Dexterity save or Acrobatics check against your infusion DC. The ice

                  <p>As an action, you blow out a stream of focused air from yourself that is 30 feet long and 5 feet
                    wide. You can aim this line vertically or horizontally, and each creature in that area must make a
                    Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage per mana spent.

                    the stream. The stream no longer deals bludgeoning damage on these subsequent turns, but it can
                    still knock creatures prone. In addition, you can move through your stream once per turn,
                    immediately traveling from the beginning to the end of it. Other Aerofusists can also travel through
                    the stream in the same manner. If your stream is blocked by an obstacle, you stop at that point. If
                    you stop in air, you fall immediately unless you have another mechanism to stay aloft.</p>
                  <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you hold concentration on this ability, any infusions from yourself or allies
                    besides Aerofusion can target the stream. The infusion triggers through the stream or at any point
                    of the stream (fusist’s choice). An enemy fusist attempting to use your stream must make a
                    Constitution save against your DC. On a success, the fusist can access your stream.</p>

                    and churns in place. It automatically quenches any fires that it can encompass fully. A bubble cage
                    stops if it moves outside the ability’s range.</p>
                  <p>The orb lasts a number of rounds equal to your Waterweaving tier. You can extend the duration of
                    the orb by expending 1 Hit Die when you activate this ability, allowing the orb to remain for an
                    additional number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier.</p>
                  <p>Your Waterweaving tier also allows you to increase the size of the orb. At tier II, you can spend
                    an additional mana to make the orb 10 feet. At tier III, you can spend a total of 3 mana to make the
                    orb 15 feet in diameter.</p>
                  <p>Any creature in the path of the orb must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 2d6
                    points of bludgeoning damage and is engulfed by the bubble cage and carried along with it. Engulfed
                    creatures are immersed in water and must hold their breath unless capable of breathing water. They
                    gain cover against attacks from outside the orb but are considered entangled by its churning
                    currents. Creatures also take 2d6 points of damage at the beginning of their turn each round they
                    remain trapped. Creatures within the orb may attempt a new Dexterity save each round to escape into
                    a random square adjacent to the bubble cage.</p>
                  <p>Depending on what tier of bubble cage you activated, your orb can hold varying sizes and numbers of
                    creatures. A tier I bubble cage can hold up to 1 Medium, 2 Small, or 4 smaller creatures within it.
                    At tier II, it can hold 1 Large, 4 Medium, or 16 Small or smaller creatures within it. At tier III,
                    the orb may hold 1 Huge creature, 2 Large creatures, 8 Medium, or 32 Small or smaller creatures
                    within it.</p>
                  <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have affinity with other infusions, you can alter your bubble cage. To use a
                    synergy, you must decide select it upon activating this ability.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Aerofusion turns the bubble cage to ice. The orb now deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 cold
                      damage to creatures in its path, but it does not capture creatures within it. Creatures can still
                      attempt a Dexterity saving throw to avoid this damage. As a bonus action or at the end of the
                      ability’s duration, you can force your ice orb to explode in a 20-foot radius +burst, dealing 6d6
                      cold damage to each creature in the area that fails a Dexterity saving throw. On a success,
                      creatures take half this damage.</li>
                    <li>Bloodfusion transforms the bubble cage into a bloody orb that drains the lifeforce out of
                      creatures. It acts as the standard bubble cage, but so long as you are within the range of the
                      orb, you heal half the damage that creatures take while entangled in the orb.</li>
                    <li>Pyrofusion heats the bubble cage, scalding creatures within and around it. It acts as the
                      standard bubble cage with the following addition:

                        <li>Creatures adjacent to the orb’s path take fire damage equal to your

                        <li>Creatures captured within take an additional 2d6

                    This transparency is not enough to grant concealment. You gain DR 10 against slashing and piercing,

                    also falling damage. The falling damage is determined by the size of the creature: Small creatures
                    are shot up 40 feet (20 falling damage), Medium creatures 30 feet (15 falling damage), Large

                  <p>A 15-foot line of fire sprays from your outstretched, free hand. This ability remains active up to
                    its duration so long as you maintain concentration and keep one hand free. If you wield a weapon,
                    shield, or perform any activity with the hand holding the burning stream, the infusion ends. This
                    ability cannot function under water, but it can synergize with applicable infusions that utilize
                    water.</p>
                  <p>All creatures in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 points of fire damage per

                    does not stack, and a creature can spend its action to extinguish the flames. Each round you

                    but don’t take damage from both lines. You may stop either line of fire at will on your turn, but
                    once you stop maintaining a line, you must expend another Hit Die to recreate a line and only so
                    long as the infusion is active. Your lines also make the area they affect difficult terrain, pushing
                    against all creatures.</p>

                    the detonation upon completing this ability and that time cannot change once it has been set unless
                    someone touches the bead. If you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its destination until it
                    detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon (range 15 feet). If a
                    creature handles and moves the bead within 1 turn of its detonation, there is a 25% chance that the
                    bead detonates while being handled.</p>
                  <p>When the bead detonates, intense explosion triggers from the target location. The explosion is a
                    30-foot radius sphere that harms all creatures and objects in its range. All creatures in the area
                    must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d6 fire damage and be knocked prone.</p>
                  <p>The longer the bead waits to detonate, the more powerful it becomes. Each turn after creating it,
                    the bead deals an additional 1d6 damage for each Fireweaving tier you master.</p>
                  <p>The explosion sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with

                      disadvantage on their saving
                      throw. In addition, creatures that are Huge or smaller are knocked prone regardless of the result
                      of the saving throw
                      (unless the creature is immune to being knocked prone).</li>
                    <li><b>Bloodfusion</b> creates a toxic gas, sickening all creatures within the area of the

                  <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have an affinity to other infusions, you can enhance your flame arrows. Your
                    arrows can only use one synergy at
                    a time, but you can change the synergy at will once per turn.
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Aerofusion</b> adds slicing wings of wind to your ammunition, adding 1 slashing damage per
                      Windweaving or Fireweaving tier
                      you have mastered, taking the highest value.</li>
                    <li><b>Bloodfusion</b> grants a blood-hungry aspect to your ammunition. Whenever you miss your
                      target while using a flame arrow,
                      you can reroll the attack. Otherwise on a hit, roll an attack against an additional creature
                      within 30 feet of your
                      original target. On a success, your flame arrow pierces through the first target and into the
                      next, dealing necrotic
                      damage equal to your Constitution modifier. (You cannot use this ability if your original attack
                      was a miss.)</li>
                    <li><b>Hydrofusion</b> strengthens the ammunition, increasing the damage added to 1d8 instead. This
                      increase also affects the
                      Empower ability of this infusion.</li>

                <li>
                  <p>A burning globe of fire 5 feet in diameter rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those
                    it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30
                    feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and
                    deals 3d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Dexterity save halves that
                    damage. A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances
                    it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.</p>
                  <p>The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it with a bonus action. Otherwise, it merely stays
                    at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a fire of its size. The
                    surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its
                    flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. The sphere winks out
                    if it exceeds the ability’s range.</p>
                  <p><b>Empower</b>: Spending an additional Hit Die and maintaining a mana pool of 2 increases the size
                    of the sphere to 10 feet in diameter and it deals 6d6 points of fire damage to any creature it
                    strikes. You can also control the sphere within 100 feet of you instead of 60 feet. Any creature
                    that fails its save against the sphere is overheated, suffering disadvantage on its next saving
                    throw or attack roll.</p>
                  <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have an affinity to other infusions, you can enhance your sphere. Your
                    sphere can only use one synergy at a
                    time, but you can change the synergy at will once per turn.
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Aerofusion</b> increases the speed of your sphere, allowing it to move 40 feet per round.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Bloodfusion</b> disrupts the flesh of the creature affected by your sphere. Creatures that
                      take damage from your sphere
                      cannot heal for 1 minute.</li>
                    <li><b>Hydrofusion</b> leaves liquid flame on the ground where your sphere travels. The route your
                      sphere moves creates difficult
                      terrain, and creatures moving into or through any area affected in this manner take fire damage
                      equal to your
                      Constitution modifier. Surfaces remain affected in this way so long as it is within 30 feet of
                      your sphere and only if
                      this synergy is active.</li>

                  <p>Fire motes feed off your energy and cloak your body in flames that do not harm you or your carried
                    equipment but damage other creatures and objects. The flames cast light as a torch. Any creature
                    that attacks you with a non-reach melee weapon or that begins its turn engaged in a grapple with you
                    takes 1d6 points of fire damage and must succeed at a Dexterity save or catch fire. A creature that
                    catches fire takes fire damage equal to your Constitution modifier at the start of its next turn.
                  </p>
                  <p>Unattended flammable objects catch fire, spreading fire to one adjacent, flammable object each
                    turn.</p>
                  <p><b>Empower</b>: You can increase the damage of this ability by 1d6 for 1 mana. Damage taken by
                    catching on fire does not increase, but its duration now lasts 2 turns instead of 1.</p>
                  <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have an affinity to other infusions, you can enhance your fire cloak. You
                    can only use one synergy at a time,
                    but you can change the synergy at will once per turn.
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Aerofusion</b> deflects attacks made against you. You can +1 to your AC.</li>
                    <li><b>Bloodfusion</b> buffers your lifeforce. At the start of each of your turns while you are
                      conscious, you gain temporary Hit
                      Points equal to your Constitution modifier.</li>
                    <li><b>Hydrofusion</b> decreases the velocity of physical attacks made against you. You gain +1
                      damage resistance against
                      piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage.</li>

                <li>
                  <p>You stir chaos in nearby fire motes, bringing them to a fierce rage that attempts to engulf
                    everything in flames. When you trigger this ability, you create a ball of wildflame in your hands.
                    Make an infused ranged attack to throw this ball at a target you see within range. On a hit, you
                    deal 2d6 fire damage per Fireweaving tier to the target and it gains the Wildfire status effect.
                    Creatures that have Wildfire on them take your Constitution modifier in fire damage at the start of
                    each of their turns for the duration of the ability.</p>
                  <p>In addition, anytime you successfully target a creature using a Pyrofusion ability with Wildfire on
                    it, you cause a contagious burst. Any creature within 10 feet of your Wildfire target must make a
                    Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take fire damage equal to your Constitution modifier and
                    catch fire as well.</p>
                  <p>Wildfire is different from other flames in that it is difficult to pat out or douse. Wildfire
                    damage does not stack with being on fire from other abilities. You are immune to catching fire from
                    this ability, but you can take fire damage from being in the vicinity of any bursts.</p>
                  <p>A creature can spend its entire turn to completely douse itself in water to put out the flames.
                    There must be an adequate supply of water to do so, or a Hydrofusion ability that has a minimum cost
                    of 1 Hit Die or 1 mana can also douse the flames. Alternatively, you can spend your reaction to
                    douse Wildfire flames on a number of creatures up to your Constitution modifier that you can see
                    within range.
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Critical failure</b>: The target takes twice the amount of fire damage on the burst. The
                      Wildfire effect remains the same.</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have an affinity to other infusions, you can enhance your wildfire. You can
                    only use one synergy at a time, but
                    you can change the synergy at will once per turn.
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Aerofusion</b> increases the burst of your wildfire. For every Windweaving tier you master,
                      your contagious burst increases
                      by 5 feet.</li>
                    <li><b>Bloodfusion</b> regenerates your lifeforce as the wildfire spreads. The first time a creature
                      gains Wildfire flames, you
                      regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier. You cannot regain Hit Points beyond your
                      maximum.</li>
                    <li><b>Hydrofusion</b> makes your Wildfire more resilient. Even when a creature douses the flames
                      from its body, it takes
                      additional fire damage equal to your Constitution modifier at the end of its turn. When water is
                      used to douse Wildfire,
                      the flames remain dangerous for one additional turn (dealing damage, spreading, or allowing
                      affects as usual). Finally,
                      any Hydrofusion abilities used to douse the flames must cost 2 Hit Die or 2 mana instead.</li>
                  </ul>

                  </p>
