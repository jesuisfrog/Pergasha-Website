        <div class="p-2" id="section1">
          <h1 class="arjulian section-title">Dreadful Options in Pergasha</h1>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Character Customization</h3>
          <p>This setting uses different creation rules. For example, your ability scores will generally be higher,
            you get a free feat at 1st level, you have built-in access to psionic
            abilities, the race options are robust and powerful, and you have greater customization. See for details.
          </p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Character Advancement</h3>
          <p>This setting uses an alternative to experience points. The party advances as a unit via Milestones to
            keep power levels even across characters. Milestones also reward the party rather than individuals for
            completing goals. See for details.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Training Points</h3>
          <p><a href="training.html">Training Points</a> are a meta-currency that you use to further customize your
            character. You can purchase skills, feats, languages, and psionic abilities.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Inspiration Points & Fate</h3>
          <p>Inspiration Points are a meta-currency used to help shift luck in your favor while Fate is a rare
            commodity that can save you from an early demise. See <a href="#section3">Inspiration Points & Cheating
              Fate</a> for details.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">A Barter Economy</h3>
          <p>Gold coins are meaningless. Pergasha has a barter economy that requires you to market your goods to get
            the best trade. If you’re clever, you can do well for yourself. See <a href="#section4">Wealth</a> for
            details.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Slot-Based Inventory</h3>
          <p>This setting uses inventory slots rather than item weight to place importance on what you carry and how
            without being overly tedious. Encumbrance and bulk matters when you’re trying to run from a giant
            sandworm. See <a href="#section5">Inventory Space</a> for details.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Expanded Combat Options</h3>
          <p>Several options for actions and strategy on the battlefield have been added to enhance combat. Falling
            prone, exhaustion, and flanking have impact, and Hit Dice can trigger different abilities and powers. See
            Combat for details.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Life & Death</h3>
          <p>Without magic, healing is harder. The world is brutal and sometimes your greatest threat is pushing your
            body too hard. You need others to survive and gather resources to recover. See Taking Damage, Healing &
            Death for details.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Survival in a Harsh Land</h3>
          <p>Careful planning of your travels, managing your supplies, pacing of your abilities is critical. See
            Resting and Recovery for details.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Strange Technology</h3>
          <p>There are no magic items in Pergasha, but there are incomprehensible fragments of technology and power
            from a lost age. Mysteriums are limited-use items that give you an edge, but they are unstable and often
            break after use. Stable or more powerful versions of these are called relics. Quirky trinkets or devices
            that seem to have no practical use are called oddities. See Mysteriums for details [still in development].
          </p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Sundered Magic & Psionics</h3>
          <p>The titans long ago had mastery of magic and the powers of the mind. While the magic and most of the
            technology tied to it is gone, psionic abilities have remained. You will have access to some amount of
            psionic power with options to gain more if you wish to pursue it. See <a href="psionics.html">Psionics</a>
            for details.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="p-2" id="section2">
          <h1 class="arjulian section-title">Gaining Levels & Abilities</h1>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Milestones</h3>
          <p>The party must earn Milestones to achieve the next level. Milestones are given to the party as a whole –
            all benefits are shared and everyone will level up as a group. After reaching six Milestones, the party
            must take a full rest to gain the benefits of leveling up.</p>
          <p>Every level is divided into six Milestones, and the party earns Milestones through consistent
            role-playing, completing story arcs, major achievements, discovering lore in the world, and quest
            completion.</p>
          <p>Notice that there is no mention of combat. Combat is knit into quests and the story and does not earn
            extra rewards (other than the fun factor). This method of reward is to prevent metagaming, seeking out
            purposeless combat, and choosing battle over role-playing through a conflict simply in hopes of gaining
            more experience points. The party also maintains unity because no one can race ahead in experience. </p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Learning New Abilities</h3>
          <p>There are two primary ways to gain new proficiencies or abilities. You can spend Proficiency Points or
            Training Points if you have them when you reach a new level. This is represented by finding an instructor,
            school, or tomes to learn new feats, skills and languages. These are beyond the improvements gained
            through your class. There is no training in time or barter required to gain class improvements.</p>
          <p>There are also rumors of spiritual repositories or ancient beings that may grant abilities to characters.
            How to find them and convince them to help you is a mystery for you to solve.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Weapon Mastery</h3>
          <p>There are no special feats for weapons. Instead, many weapons have built-in combat abilities available to
            anyone who is proficient and spends effort to master it.</p>
          <p> To begin training with a weapon, you must inform the GM of your intentions, make a concerted effort to
            utilize this weapon as your primary in combat, and use downtime when available to train with the weapon.
            There is no XP or progress to track for mastery, but you need to spend most of a level with it. The GM
            will determine if enough time has been spent with a weapon to qualify mastery.</p>
          <p> If a weapon has multiple levels of mastery, each ability must be mastered one level at a time. If you
            acquire an improved version of a similar weapon (for example, a better light crossbow), you keep any
            masteries you have already acquired.</p>
          <p> Finding a trainer or learning with an ally who has already mastered the same weapon may decrease the
            length of time needed to master a weapon. </p>
          <!-- <h3 class="arjulian">Multiclassing</h3>
          <p>The GM needs to be informed in advance regarding multiclassing. You need to have a reasonable explanation
            as to how you acquire the skills and roleplay that in the level prior to you taking the new class. This
            means you cannot decide to multiclass at the moment you gain a new level – you need to plan ahead. </p>
          <p> For example, if you are a 3rd level Rogue and you would like to take a level in Fighter, you must
            roleplay during this third level how you slowly acquire some of the necessary skills to become proficient
            in this new style of combat. You could get training from a fellow party member and spar during downtime or
            evenings at camp, read manuals on combat, and take notes while observing combat situations. </p> -->
        </div>
        <div class="p-2" id="section3">
          <h1 class="arjulian section-title">Inspiration Points & Cheating Fate</h1>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Inspiration</h3>
          <p>Inspiration Points are rewards for:
          <ul>
            <li>Playing your character in an interesting and impactful fashion.</li>
            <li>Problem-solving and cooperating as a team with your party
              members.</li>
            <li>Camping activities.</li>
            <li>End-of-session shout-outs from the table.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p> You can have a total of 3 Inspiration Points. If you are at your
            maximum, you cannot gain more Inspiration Points. You also cannot
            instantly use one to avoid missing out on a reward. At the end of
            every session, your Inspiration Points reset to 1. If you receive the
            end-of-session shout-out, you reset your points to 2 instead of 1. </p>
          <div class="ruleBox">
            <h3 class="ruleBoxTitle arjulian p-2">Using Inspiration</h3>
            <p class="p-2">If you have inspiration, you can expend it to do one of the following:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Reroll: </b>After making a saving throw, skill check, or ability check, you may reroll the d20.
                You must keep the second result.</li>
              <li><b>Nudge: </b>After making an attack roll, you may add 1d4 to the total, potentially turning a miss
                into a hit.</li>
              <li><b>Interrupt: </b>If you have not taken your turn yet this round, you can steal the initiative and
                take the next turn. Your initiative score is unchanged for subsequent rounds.</li>
              <li><b>Ability: </b>Some abilities may require the use of inspiration to activate or
                empower.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="arjulian">Fate</h3>
          <p>Even in the face of certain death in a land without magic, some are lucky enough to find a way to cheat
            fate to live to fight another day. </p>
          <p> Fate allows your character to survive what would otherwise be a certain death. If you would suffer a
            killing blow or fail your last death saving throw, you may instead spend Fate to cheat death in some
            fashion. </p>
          <p> Perhaps you were knocked unconscious, or the attack just wasn’t enough to finish you off, or maybe it
            was just a flesh wound. Discuss with the GM exactly how you managed to survive the ordeal. </p>
          <p> New characters join with Fate. You either have Fate or you do not, and you cannot spend your own Fate
            for another.</p>

          <h5 class="arjulian">Spending Fate</h5>
          <p>When you spend your Fate, you cannot act for the rest of the scene. Everyone—friend and foe alike—thinks
            you’re dead or otherwise not worth any attention. But you are immune to any further damage during the rest
            of the scene, regardless of whatever else happens around your unconscious body. </p>
          <p>At the end of the scene—or whenever appropriate—you regain consciousness with 1 hit point.</p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Gaining Fate</h5>
          <p>Fate is rare and precious. A new character starts with it, but beyond this, it can only be gained by
            facing and defeating the most dangerous monsters of the world, given at a place of power, or granted by a
            being of immense power. </p>
          <p> Fated creatures are significant threats to the party and are optional dangers. Defeating a fated monster
            rewards only 1 Fate, and the players must decide who among them is lucky enough to take it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-2" id="section4">
          <h1 class="arjulian section-title">Wealth</h1>
          <p>Pergasha does not mint coins and without magic, precious gems and metals like gold or platinum have
            diminished value. These materials are now only precious to artists, researchers, adventurers planning to
            cross the Chasm, or the extremely vain. </p>
          <p> Mysterious technology known as mysteriums and relics sometimes utilize these and other supplies, so they
            have value to the right person. However, mysteriums are widely unstable and thus are not used as a basis
            of power or wealth.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Trade</h3>
          <p> Instead, the economy is reliant on trade goods. Barter includes raw materials, crafted goods, livestock,
            services, food, spices, and psi-crystals, with the latter being of utmost value. A shard of charged
            psi-crystal can be worth more than a wagon of premium spices or weapons enough for a small militia. </p>
          <p> The few cities that exist sometimes trade in psi-crystals to help power valuable artifacts or
            individuals, but most people do not have the means to utilize such a resource. The weather and
            unpredictability of the bounty of gentler seasons makes the market shift regularly, but food and potable
            water are always valued. </p>
          <p> These uncertainties make it difficult to invest, plan, and accumulate wealth. For the most part, the
            people of Pergasha are less concerned about the status of wealth and more focused on survival, security,
            and empowering psionically-gifted tribe leaders with psi-crystals. </p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Drifters</h3>
          <p> Clever and enterprising individuals known as drifters have established clans of their own by reading the
            weather, the shifts in temperament between clans and tribes, and gambling as to what commodity will reign
            for the season. These wily folks travel between the few sedentary regions and the abundant nomadic groups,
            turning seemingly insignificant excess from one group into invaluable goods.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Barter Points and Trade Goods</h3>
          <p>Barter points are a meta way to quickly calculate wealth to use for simple trade. Goods of a similar
            value are grouped in categories to help organize your inventory. </p>
          <p> General items like gear you no longer use, simple gems, common spices, and crafting materials you intend
            to use as barter take up space and inventory slots. They are given a value in barter points within these
            categories: Common, Uncommon, Greater, and Premium Barter. </p>
          <p><b>Common Barter (CB).</b> Common barter is often simple goods or materials like one pound of basic black
            pepper, a simple shiv, a crude but filling meal or ration. Depending on the needs of an area, a live
            chicken or a gallon of untreated water may also be considered common barter. </p>
          <p><b>Uncommon Barter (UB).</b> Uncommon barter often involves goods or materials that require skilled
            labor, are more difficult to acquire or find, are less abundant, or are of greater importance to survival.
            Some examples are one pound of salt, a tiny collection of flawed gems, a basic dagger, a week of rations,
            a live goat or dog, a small wooden shield, a bolt of sturdy but rough fabric, treated hide or leather, raw
            metal ore, or simple tools or instruments.</p>
          <p><b>Greater Barter (GB).</b> Greater barter are goods that are rare, require skill to produce, or great
            efforts to acquire. Some examples include a jar of turmeric, a small collection of clear gems, a quality
            weapon, hide or leather armor, a horse or similar pack animal, metal ingots or bars, a 2-wheeled cart, a
            bolt of quality fabric, and quality tools or instruments. </p>
          <p><b>Premium Barter (PB).</b>Premium barter are goods, services, and materials that are extremely rare for
            the common person to own. Many skilled crafters or laborers were involved in the production, brave animal
            handlers of great talent captured creatures, and only the keenest and luckiest of seekers can find and
            risk venturing out to acquire these raw materials. Some examples include a small bundle of vanilla beans,
            fresh fruit, quality gems, pieces of heavy metal armor, a rare creature like an adolescent sand worm, a
            covered wagon, and a bolt of crystalline worm silk. </p>
          <p> Specialty trade goods like unusual spices, valuable gems, masterwork equipment, and ingredients
            harvested from rare creatures you should note so that you can negotiate the best trades for them in the
            future. </p>
          <p> Mysteriums can be categorized in a number of ways depending on their quality, use, and stability. Some
            mysteriums you may want to save for personal use while others are useful as barter for their raw
            materials. </p>
          <p> Relics and psi-crystals are in a league of their own and are never converted into barter points. Common
            people cannot afford to trade for these items. Instead, you will need to find major clan heads, tribal
            leaders, or perhaps a drifter. </p>
          <p> It’s important to remember that with a barter economy, values can fluctuate quickly, and a smooth talker
            can usually get a better trade.</p>

          <h1 class="arjulian section-title">Inventory Space</h1>
          <p>Instead of trying to monitor how much weight you carry, you will use a slot-based inventory system. It
            helps with simplifying values, appreciating the bulk of items, and feeling the impact of your character’s
            physicality in a world without magic. </p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Slot-Based Inventory</h3>
          <p>Item slots—abstract slots to represent storage capacity of containers and yourself—are used to manage
            inventory. The more slots you have, the more you can carry. Your size, strength, and armor influence the
            number of slots you have at your disposal. Gaining pack animals and being clever with storage containers
            will help you even further.</p>

              ability score of 19 (+4 modifier, +1 for an odd-numbered Strength score, for a total of <b>+5</b>
              slots). He can carry 26 slots of inventory. He wears a Dense Padded Coat underlay (<b>2</b> slots), a
              Hide Coat mesolay (<b>2</b> slots) and a Plastron Shirt overlay (<b>2</b> slots), using a total of 6

          <h3 class="arjulian">Free to Carry</h3>
          <p>You can freely carry one ration box, one waterskin, and one purse or pouch. These do not require
            inventory slots and can store food, water, and personal effects or tiny barter.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Ration box. </b>Up to five basic food rations. This is appropriately sized to your character.</li>
            <li><b>Waterskin. </b>Up to five drink rations. This is appropriately sized to your character.</li>
            <li><b>Purse/Pouch. </b>A small collection of tiny items such as 5 gemstones.</li>
          </ul>
          Additionally, gear marked as free-handed or worn items such as clothing, boots, and hats do not occupy any
          inventory space unless you unequip and store them. Only armor, because of bulk, affect inventory slots.
          However, any items on your character can be affected by NPCs and monsters regardless of inventory slot
          usage.

          <h3 class="arjulian">Interacting with the Inventory</h3>
          <p>You must draw an item from your inventory before you can use it. During your turn, you may use your one
            free object interaction with your inventory to:
          <ul>
            <li>Add/sheathe one item (or collection of tiny items).</li>
            <li>Remove/draw one item (or collection of tiny items).</li>
          </ul>
          To make a second change to your inventory during the same turn or to interact with another character’s

          <h3 class="arjulian">Encumbrance</h3>
          <p>When you carry more than your capacity allows, you are encumbered. Depending on how much you burden
            yourself and for how long, you will suffer different levels of discomfort. </p>
          <p> If you are encumbered for more than 4 hours, you will require two times the amount of food and water for

          <p>Vehicles—mules, carts, ships, trains—store items in the same way as characters: using item slots.
            Vehicles generally come in four sizes—anything larger is assumed to have as many slots as it needs.</p>

          <p>A vehicle's storage capacity may be divided into separate compartments. A mule, for example, may carry
            two 9-slot bags, while a cart has a single 32-slot space.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Chests, Crates & Barrels</h3>
          <p>Some items can only safely be transported in bulk within storage containers—chests, crates, and barrels.
            These containers hold a number of slots equal to their size:
          <ul>
            <li>A small chest fills 1 slot and holds 1 item slot.</li>
            <li>A large crate fills 3 slots and holds 3 item slots.</li>
            <li>An xx-large barrel fills 9 slots and holds 9 item slots.</li>

          <h3 class="arjulian">Quickdraw</h3>
          <p>You may nominate any 3 items in your inventory as quickdraw items. These can be drawn/removed from the
            inventory as a free object interaction as normal. However, any non-quickdraw items can only be accessed
            using a full action. It is important to consider your inventory carefully, but there are special
            containers available that add to your quickdraw slots. You can rearrange your inventory and change
            quickdraw items outside of combat.</p>

          <h1 class="arjulian section-title">Combat</h1>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Expanded Conditions</h3>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Grappled</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><b>NEW:</b> Attacks targeting the grappled creature are at disadvantage unless a Light or Natural
              weapon is used.</li>
            <li><b>NEW:</b> A grappled creature has disadvantage to attack creatures that are not grappling it.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Rising from Prone</h5>
          <p>Rising from a throw or fall is a difficult thing in the heat of battle. It takes training and skill to do
            so very quickly and even more so when faced with an aggressive adversary. </p>
          <p> You must spend half your movement to stand from prone. When threatened, you can attempt to stand up by
            making a Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) skill check at DC 10 + 2 for each enemy within
            their reach with you. Failure provokes an attack of opportunity reaction from all opponents within reach.
            If any opportunity attack roll beats your AC by 10 or more, you remain prone.</p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Susceptible (NEW)</h5>
          <p>Susceptibility is lesser variant of Vulnerability. Creatures susceptible to a damage type take extra
            damage from that damage type. Susceptibility has damage type and a value (typically 5) or a die size. For
            example, if a creature has Fire Susceptibility 1d10, then any time it takes fire damage, it takes an extra
            1d10 fire damage.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Combat Actions</h3>
          <p>Combat Actions are common martial techniques available to anyone of any class. When you use your action
            to Attack, you can choose to use one Combat Action until the start of your next turn. </p>
          <p>To use a Combat Action, your weapon must have one of the properties listed next to its name, and you must
            be proficient with it.</p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Aim (Ranged)</h5>
          <p>Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to use your
            bonus action to aim. You gain a +2 bonus to your next attack. This bonus can only be applied once per
            attack action.</p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Body-Shield</h5>
          <p>While a creature is grappled by you, you may use half your movement to make an opposed grapple check
            against that creature in order to position it in such a way that it shields you from one or more hostile
            creatures that you are aware of. If the creature is of your size it provides half cover (+2 AC) or if the
            creature is one size larger than yourself, threequarters cover (+5 AC). </p>
          <p> If the grappled creature is stunned, paralyzed or unconscious, the DC for the Strength (Athletics) check
            is 12.</p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Charge</h5>
          <p>When you move at least 20 feet towards a target, you may declare a charge attack as an action. You must
            have a clear path towards your target, and nothing should hinder your path (such as difficult terrain or
            obstacles). If you finish your movement within reach of your target, you may use your action to follow it
            with one of these options:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Strike. </b>You may make a single melee attack with advantage. The attack deals additional damage
              equal to the distance you charged divided by 5, up to your Strength or Constitution modifier (your
              choice, minimum of 1). If you are riding a mounted animal that provides the movement instead of you, you
              may use its Strength or Constitution instead your own.</li>
            <li><b>Slam. </b>You may perform the Shove action with advantage. If you succeed, the creature is shoved
              twice the normal distance, or shoved as normal then knocked prone. You may choose to move up to five
              feet in the direction you are shoving your target. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity
              from your target.</li>
            <li><b>Tackle. </b>You may make a single Grapple attempt with advantage. If the Grapple fails, you provoke
              an attack of opportunity from your target and are knocked prone. If you succeed, both you and your
              opponent are knocked prone and your target is subjected to the Grappled condition.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Climb onto a Bigger Creature</h5>
          <p>If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by grappling. A small or Medium
            creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however,
            unless psionics has granted the grappler supernatural might. </p>
          <p> As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto
            its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto
            the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity
            (Acrobatics) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If it wins the contest, the
            smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space, the smaller creature moves with the
            target and has advantage on attack rolls against it. </p>
          <p> The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult
            terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's
            location and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an
            action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength
            (Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
            check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.</p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Feint (Light or Finesse)</h5>
          <p>Before you make an attack with a light or finesse melee weapon that you are proficient with, you can
            choose to use half your movement to perform a feint and fake out your opponent. </p>
          <p> Make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight). If you succeed, you have
            advantage on that attack.</p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Flanking</h5>
          <p>When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners
            of the enemy's space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has +2 on melee attack rolls against that
            enemy. </p>
          <p> When in doubt about whether two creatures flank an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between the
            centers of the creatures' spaces. If the line passes through opposite sides or corners of the enemy's
            space, the enemy is flanked. </p>
          <p> If a creature is Huge or larger, flanking can only occur if at least half of the squares on opposing
            sides are being threatened. </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Overrun</h5>
          <p>When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, the mover can try to force its way
            through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength
            (Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting
            the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it
            is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this
            turn.</p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Power Attack (Heavy)</h5>
          <p>Before you make an attack with a heavy melee weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take
            a -5 penalty to the attack roll and attempt to put more of your raw strength behind a blow that deals
            extra damage. If the attack hits, you add 2 + your Strength modifier (minimum 1) to the attack's damage.
          </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Raise Shield</h5>
          <p>If you are wielding a shield and you are hit by an attack roll that is equal to or only one greater than
            your AC, you may use your reaction to interpose your shield between yourself and the attack. The attack
            deals you no damage, but your shield is damaged in the process. It suffers a -1 penalty to its AC each
            time you block in this fashion. If your shield's AC reaches 0, it is destroyed.</p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Shove</h5>
          <p>Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it
            prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this
            attack replaces one of them. </p>
          <p> The target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your
            reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity
            (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is
            incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Critical Failure & Consequences</h3>
          <p> When you roll a 1 on a d20 during combat, you not only may fail in your attack but also you may suffer
            some other Consequence as determined by the GM. You may use an Inspiration Point to cancel a consequence.
            However, if you accept the consequence, you receive an Inspiration Point. You cannot receive an
            Inspiration Point if you are at your maximum.</p>
          <div class="ruleBox">
            <h3 class="ruleBoxTitle arjulian p-2">Examples of Consequences</h3>
            <p class="p-2">Depending on the situation, consequences range from harmless to painful. Here are some
              examples:
            <ul>
              <li>While grappling your foe, your pants split open. Everyone sees, everyone laughs.</li>
              <li>Your wild swing sends your axe flying out of your hand. Hope you have a back-up or else you’ll need
                to fetch it.</li>
              <li>Your clumsy strike weakens your defense. Your foe gets advantage on its next attack against you.
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Critical Hits</h3>
          <p>The other side of the coin is that when you roll a natural 20, you succeed. Rolling a natural 20 or a
            critical hit for an attack roll doubles the damage dice of the attack. The extra
            damage dice include the weapon’s damage, sneak attack damage, and any abilities that are triggered before
            the attack roll is made (for example, paying Psi Points for bonus damage). Any abilities that you trigger
            as a reaction or result of a successful hit are rolled normally.</p>
          <div class="ruleBox">
            <h3 class="ruleBoxTitle arjulian p-2">Critical Hit Example</h3>
            <p class="p-2"><i>Nika the rogue spends 1 Psi Point and uses her bonus action to evoke the psionic power
                Brute Strike. For her action, she attacks her target from her hidden position with advantage. She
                rolls a natural 20, giving her extra damage from her dagger, her sneak attack, and her Brute Strike.
                She rolls the base damage of 2 (1d4 from her dagger) + 4 (1d6 from sneak attack) + 5 (1d8 from Brute
                Strike) for a total of <b>11</b> base damage. Then she adds her critical hit bonus damage which is the
                maximum value of all those dice: 4 (dagger) + 6 (sneak attack) + 8 (Brute Strike), for a total of
                <b>18</b>. She adds her Dexterity modifier bonus of <b>4</b>, for a grand total of <b>33</b>

          <h1 class="arjulian section-title">Injuries, Exhaustion & Death</h1>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Bloodied</h3>
          <p>Your health is your most precious resource and, as an adventurer, keeping hold of it is not an easy task.
            A character is considered bloodied when they have lost half of their hit points—when bloodied, they have
            taken a cut or bruise. </p>
          <p> Some monsters may react differently to you when you are bloodied—becoming frenzied or
            blood-thirsty—while others may have an easier time detecting you by scent. </p>
          <p> If you are bloodied, it’s a little harder to recover stamina. While bloodied, you must use a bandage,
            healer’s kit, or similar first-aid to spend Hit Dice and recover hit points when resting.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Exhaustion</h3>
          <p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of
            freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. This condition
            covers all effects from casual exhaustion to life drain and is measured in six levels. An effect can give
            a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description. </p>
          <p>For each level of exhaustion you have, any psionic abilities require 1 extra Psi Point to activate,
            including Talents. If you have 4 or more levels of exhaustion, you must take a full rest to recover. Long
            rests can only help recover the first 3 levels of exhaustion, as greater comfort and focused care are
            required.</p>

          <h3 class="arjulian">Knocking a Creature Out</h3>
          <p>Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker
            reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The
            attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is
            stable.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Dying</h3>
          <p>When you drop to 0 hit points and start dying, you gain one level of exhaustion that comes into effect
            immediately when you are stabilized. You cannot gain more than one level of exhaustion due to dropping to
            0 hit points in the same combat. This exhaustion lingers until you properly rest and recover, or an
            ability lifts it from you.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Stabilizing a Dying Character</h3>
          <p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death
            saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. </p>
          <p> When performing a Death Save, you must meet or exceed a DC with a d20 roll. An ally can attempt a DC 10
            Wisdom (Medicine) check to help stabilize you. If your ally uses a healer’s kit or similar equipment, they
            have advantage on the roll. A success on that roll lowers your DC as shown below, while a critical success
            stabilizes you immediately. </p>
          <p> After you are stabilized, you suffer one level of exhaustion. If you roll a natural 20 on a Death Save,
            you are stabilized, suffer one level of exhaustion, and awaken with 1 + your Constitution modifier in hit
            points (minimum 1). You recover 1 failed Death Save when you take a long rest. </p>

          <p>On your third successful Death Save, you are stabilized. If you roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two
            failures. You are instantly stabilized if you recover hit points or are healed through a special ability.
          </p>
          <p><b>Damage at 0 Hit Points.</b> If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death
            saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage
            equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Death</h3>
          <p>In a land without magic, there is no recourse for death. Pergasha is a dangerous place, and even the most
            epic adventurer can meet an untimely demise. All things must come to an end, and your character is
            unfortunately no exception. </p>
          <p> Hopefully you fought a good fight and left the world a little less dark than when you first joined it.
            And you can be sure that your body won’t go to waste in Pergasha. </p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Funerals</h3>
          <p>A hero deserves a proper send-off. If your party is able to recover your body, bury it, and throw an
            appropriately lavish funeral (at least 1 common barter for each of your character levels per person), they
            can gain one boon from you from beyond the grave. Each character gains 1 Inspiration Point for
            commemorating you and your memory well, and the party gains 1 Milestone.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Your Will</h3>
          <p>You can leave a will behind to confirm the heirs to your property. This can be arranged in retrospect
            with the GM after the character's death if necessary. You can will your property to your new character,
            the party (with limitations), or to NPCs in your backstory. The reading of the will usually takes place at
            your funeral, or before the introduction of your new character. </p>
          <p>This might be the last opportunity for your character to say any final words, so make the most of it.</p>

        <div class="p-2" id="section8">
          <h1 class="arjulian section-title">Resting & Recovery</h1>
          <p>Even the stoutest of heroes need rest to recover from injury and avoid exhaustion. This section defines
            different rest periods, what can be done during each period, recovery options, camping and downtime
            activities.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Breather</h3>
          <p>Taking a breather is a short period of rest that is <b>at least 5 minutes long</b> done after strenuous
            activity. During this time, you may rest, slake your thirst and hunger, rearrange equipment that is easily
            accessible, or tend to simple sounds. </p>
          <p> During a breather, you regain your Constitution modifier in hit points (minimum 0). If you have a wound,
            you may use a healer’s kit or similar item to dress it. If you use class, racial, or psionic abilities
            that heal during a breather, you recover 1 additional hit point.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Short Rest</h3>
          <p>A short rest is a period of downtime,<b> at least 1 hour long</b>, during which you do nothing more
            strenuous than light activity like eating, drinking, meditating, and tending to wounds. </p>
          <p> You can spend 1 Hit Die at the end of a short rest for recovery, gaining that roll plus your
            Constitution modifier (minimum 0) in hit points. If you are bloodied, you must use a healer’s kit to heal
            with Hit Dice. Alternatively, you regain your Constitution modifier in hit points (minimum 1) if you do
            not use any Hit Die to recover. If you use class, racial, or psionic abilities to heal during a short
            rest, you gain 2 additional hit points. </p>
          <p> You may eat 1 ration of food or water to remove a level of exhaustion if you have exactly one level of
            exhaustion affecting you.</p>
          <p> You cannot benefit from more than two short rests in a 24-hour period, and you must have at least 1 hit
            point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Long Rest</h3>
          <p>A long rest is a period of extended downtime that is <b>at least 8 hours long</b> during which a
            character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity such as camp
            activities, reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of
            strenuous activity such as combat, 1 hour of walking, or similar adventuring activities, you must begin
            the rest again to gain any benefits. </p>
          <p> During a long rest, you must consume at least 1 food and 1 water ration. If you cannot provide both, you
            gain one level of exhaustion. Providing both forms of sustenance removes one level of exhaustion and 1
            failed death save from you. If you sleep in medium or heavy armor, you cannot reduce any levels of
            Exhaustion or failed death saves during rest.</p>
          <p> At the end of a long rest, you recover your Constitution modifier in hit points (minimum 1). If you use
            any racial, class, or psionic abilities to heal, you gain 3 extra hit points. Also, you can roll any
            number of Hit Die to heal for the value you roll plus your Constitution modifier for each die (minimum 0).
            If you are bloodied, you must use a healer’s kit to heal with Hit Dice.</p>
          <p> You also regain your Constitution modifier in Hit Die (minimum 1) as well as twice your Intelligence
            modifier in Psi Points (minimum 1).</p>
          <p> You cannot benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and you must have at least 1 hit
            point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Full Rest</h3>
          <p>A full rest is a period of downtime,<b> at least 24 hours long</b>, during which you sleep for at least 6
            hours and perform light work (such as camp activities) for no more than 2 hours. A full rest cannot be
            attempted without comfortable accommodations, while sleeping on the hard ground, or while wearing armor.
            You must be in a safe location or sanctuary where you do not feel the need to keep watch or constantly be
            on guard. </p>
          <p> You must consume at least 1 ration of food and 2 rations of water during your rest. If you do not
            provide both, you cannot remove any levels of Exhaustion or failed death saves. Proper sustenance and rest
            will recover up to 2 levels of Exhaustion and reset all failed death saves. </p>
          <p> At the end of a full rest, you recover all lost hit points, spent Hit Dice, and Psi points. Any racial,
            class, or psionic abilities also reset, and any mysteriums that can recharge do so. If you have no
            Inspiration Points, you gain 1.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Setting Camp</h3>
          <p>Setting up camp allows prolonged periods of rest, greater comfort, or time and ability to perform more
            complicated tasks. The party must find a secure site, start a campfire, prepare tents or sleeping
            arrangements, and secure animals, vehicles, or cargo.</p>
          <div class="ruleBox">
            <h3 class="arjulian ruleBoxTitle p-2">Basics to Camp</h3>
            <p class="p-2">To properly set up camp, the following steps should be performed.
            <ul>
              <li><b>Make Camp: </b>The GM will determine the DC for all camping activities depending on the
                environment.</li>

              <li><b>Camp Activities: </b>Party members who are not on Lookout duty can perform one primary

          </table>

          <h4 class="arjulian">Camp Activities</h4>
          <p>While camping, you can perform one primary activity (in addition to the normal basic activities) before
            you sleep. Below are listed some example activities—if an activity is not covered here, discuss it with
            the GM</p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Cook Food</h5>
          <p>If you are proficient with Cook’s Utensils or in Wisdom (Survival) and have adequate supplies, you can
            prepare a meal for the group. This requires the use of a campfire and cooking tools. You may attempt one
            of the following activities provided you have the appropriate proficiency and supplies:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Create Rations: </b>During a long rest, you slow-cook and preserve some fresh ingredients—usually
              meat or grains—to create 1d6 + 1 new, basic food rations that can be preserved. (Proficiency: Cook’s
              Utensils)</li>
            <li><b>Stretch Rations: </b>While camping during a long rest, you thin out some basic rations into a
              simple meal, feeding two people for each ration you cook provided that you have sufficient food and
              supplies. If cooked successfully, everyone who eats gains 1d4 + 1 hit points. A creature can only
              recover hit points from this type of meal once per day. (Proficiency: Cook’s Utensils)</li>
            <li><b>Cook a Hot Meal: </b>You cook a hot meal for everyone, using one ration (or ration substitute) per
              person. If cooked successfully, everyone who eats the hot meal regains 1 spent Hit Die. A creature can
              only regain Hit Die from a hot meal once per day. (Proficiencies: Survival or Cook’s Utensils)</li>
          </ul>
          Before you serve the meal, roll your Cook’s Utensils or a Wisdom (Survival) check to see how well you
          prepared everything. Meals spoil after an hour, losing any restorative properties.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Exceptional Success: </b>The meal is extraordinary and recovers an extra Hit Die to each creature
              that eats the meal.</li>
            <li><b>Success: </b>The meal is well made.</li>
            <li><b>Failure: </b>You spoiled the meal and wasted the ingredients. No one can eat your cooking and gain
              any restorative properties.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Brew Drinks</h5>
          <p>If you are proficient with Brewer’s Supplies or Wisdom (Survival) and have the right tools, you can
            prepare drinks for the group. This requires a campfire and brewing supplies such as a pot. You may attempt
            one of the following activities provided you have the appropriate proficiency and supplies:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Create Potable Water: </b>Your knowledge of brewing enables you to purify water that would
              otherwise be undrinkable. As part of a long rest, you can purify up to 6 rations of water, or 1 ration
              as part of a short rest. (Proficiency: Brewer’s Supplies)</li>
            <li><b>Brew a Restorative: </b>As part of a short rest or camping activities, you turn some potable water
              into a tasty, hot drink. You use one ration of water to make 5 portions that must be enjoyed
              immediately. Everyone who drinks a fresh restorative regains 1 spent Hit Die. A creature can only
              benefit from a brewed restorative once per day. (Proficiency: Brewer’s Supplies)</li>
            <li><b>Brew a Balm: </b>With a few herbs you turn some basic water rations into a delicious, soothing
              drink—one ration per two drinks. Everyone who drinks a fresh balm gains 1d4 + 1 hit points. A creature
              can only benefit from a balm once per day. (Proficiency: Survival or Brewer’s Supplies)</li>
          </ul>
          Before you serve the drinks, roll your Brewer’s Supplies or a Wisdom (Survival) check to see how well you
          prepared everything. Your brews lose their restorative properties after an hour.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Exceptional Success: </b>The balms are of superior quality and everyone who drinks gains 1d6+1 hit
              points.</li>
            <li><b>Success: </b>The drinks are well made.</li>
            <li><b>Failure: </b>You spoiled the brew and wasted the ingredients—no one can stomach your drinks.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Forage and Gather</h5>
          <p>
            Foraging for supplies and food is a crucial part of survival. Not all areas are equally generous in their
            bounty, but a clever survivalist will know how to make the most of what it available. Knowledge in Nature,
            Herbalism, or Survival is necessary to find useful—and safe—supplies in the wild.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Exceptional Success: </b>You gather enough supplies to feed or cook a meal for three medium
              creatures.</li>
            <li><b>Success: </b>You gather enough supplies to feed or cook a meal for two medium creatures.</li>
            <li><b>Failure: </b>You are unable to find anything safe or useful.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Lookout</h5>
          <p>Lacking any camp defense is risky—and stupid. The lookout oversees security and watches for potential
            threats so that others can rest. </p>
          <p> If you are the lookout, roll an Intelligence (Survival) check to see how well you secure camp against
            potential dangers. If you have any tools, equipment, trained pets, or abilities that may help, you may
            roll your check with advantage. </p>
          <p> Being on lookout takes focus. If you are on lookout duty, you cannot join in any camp activities besides
            eating, drinking, and sleeping.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Exceptional Success: </b>Gain an Inspiration Point.</li>
            <li><b>Success: </b>You noted weak spots in the camp’s defense and secured them. </li>
            <li><b>Failure: </b>You did not find gaps in camp’s security. You have disadvantage on Perception checks
              against any would-be intruders while camping.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <div class="ruleBox">
            <h3 class="arjulian ruleBoxTitle p-2">Ambushed</h3>
            <p class="p-2">A warm campfire and the smell of delicious, hot food can attract attention out in the dark
              wilds—from
              cruel bandits, to hungry bears, to bloodthirsty cultists. If you let your guard down, you might find both
              your sleep and your life cut surprisingly short. </p>
            <p class="p-2"> If an intruder approaches, the lookout rolls a Wisdom (Perception) check against the
              intruder's Stealth:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Success:</b> The lookout detects the intruders and may rouse the party with enough time for people
                to don light armor.</li>
              <li><b>Failure:</b> The lookout—and the rest of the party—are caught off-guard and surprised.</li>

            <p class="p-2">Occasionally, the GM may ask the lookout to make a Wisdom (Insight) roll to detect a false
              alarm:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Success: </b>The lookout realizes that it’s just a false alarm and doesn’t rouse the party.</li>
              <li><b>Failure: </b>The lookout wakes the party unnecessarily. Their sleep is disturbed for the rest of
                the night.</li>

            If you know how to play an instrument, dance, or sing, you can attempt to perform for the group. Roll a
            Charisma or
            Dexterity (Performance) check to see how well you perform.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Exceptional Success: </b>Your performance was amazing. Your party members gain an additional bonus
              equal to your Charisma or Dexterity modifier
              to their camping checks. </li>
            <li><b>Success: </b>You perform well and entertain your allies. Your party members gain a d4 bonus to their

              increases by one die category when you reach certain levels: 5th (d6), 11th (d8), and 17th (d10).</li>
            <li><b>Failure: </b>You made an embarrassing mistake. </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Tell Story</h5>
          <p>
            Everyone likes to hear a good story. If you are proficient in Mysteriums, History, Psionics, are literate
            and carrying an interesting text, or have the Skald feat—you can attempt to tell a captivating story to
            the group. Roll a Charisma (Performance) check.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Exceptional Success: </b>Your story moves the soul. Choose two party members other than yourself or
              the lookout—those characters gain a point of inspiration. </li>
            <li><b>Success: </b>Your story is well told and inspires an ally. Choose a party member other than
              yourself or the lookout—that character gains a point of inspiration.</li>
            <li><b>Failure: </b>You made an embarrassing mistake.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Tinker with an Item</h5>
          <p>
            Sometimes, you find unusual items that have no clear purpose. If you are proficient in Mysteriums or with
            Tinker’s
            Tools, you can attempt to piece together the capabilities of mysteriums and oddities. Roll an Intelligence
            (Mysterium or
            Tinker’s Tools) check.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Exceptional Success: </b>You can understand the usage of two items. </li>
            <li><b>Success: </b>You can understand the usage of one item.</li>

            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Relax or Meditate</h5>
          <p>
            If you prefer to spend some time alone—meditating, painting, whittling, watching the stars—you can do so.
            Roll a Wisdom ability check to see if you can unwind.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Exceptional Success: </b>Your mind is invigorated. Select two out of the three: one point of
              inspiration, your Intelligence modifier in Psi
              Points, or remove one level of Fatigue. You cannot double up on any options.</li>
            <li><b>Success: </b>You feel refreshed—gain your Intelligence modifier in Psi Points or remove one level of
              Fatigue.</li>
            <li><b>Failure: </b>You couldn’t relax as something—or someone—was irritating you too much.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h4 class="arjulian">Sleeping</h4>
          <p>
            Sometimes rest is the best medicine. When you attempt to sleep, make a sleeping check (Constitution check)
            against the Camping Check DC. If you are sleeping in a bedroll, tent, or other comfortable arrangement,
            you roll with advantage. On the other hand, if you are wearing armor, you roll with disadvantage. </p>
          <p> Even though the lookout is on active guard duty, they can still make a sleeping check. They roll with
            disadvantage because it is hard to feel fully refreshed with split sleep or after a night on watch.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Success: </b>Your sleep was deep and undisrupted. Regain 1 spent Hit Die in addition to other long
              rest benefits.</li>
            <li><b>Failure: </b>You were restless. You still gain the usual long rest benefits.</li>
            <li><b>Critical Failure: </b>You cannot regain any levels of exhaustion regardless of other long rest
              benefits.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h4 class="arjulian">Packing Up</h4>
          <p>Once you decide to continue your journey, it is time to pack up your campsite. The amount of time it
            takes depends on the size and permanency of your camp and whether you need to disguise your presence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-2" id="section9">
          <h1 class="arjulian section-title">How Skills Work</h1>
          <p>In general, when there are no consequences for failure, a task is deemed impossible to fail, or there are
            no stressors (such as time) to prevent success, skill checks will not be rolled. Your success is assumed.
            See more in Passive Knowledge Checks below. </p>
          <p> However, on some occasions, you may decide you’d like to add flavor, pizzazz, or humor to an action or
            scene. You may opt to roll for these situations. </p>
          <p> When rolls are made, you can be sure they are important!</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Passive Knowledge</h3>
          <p>All knowledge checks (History, Nature, Psionics, Mysterium) will be based on a flat value. The value is
            equal to <b>10 + your Proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</b>. Bonuses will be given
            situationally to those who have specialized knowledge due to backstories. Knowledge checks using this flat
            value will be used to determine what lore or facts a character knows. This is to represent the knowledge
            already known and stored in memory. </p>
          <p> Passive knowledge scores will also be used when trying to ascertain known lore in relation to other
            skills that are not normally knowledge-type skills. For example, blacksmithing requires physical strength,
            so crafting with these tools requires a skill check. The bonus to the roll is your Proficiency bonus +
            Strength modifier. However, to determine what you know about blacksmithing or to gauge how well a weapon
            was made will be a passive knowledge check using your <b>Intelligence</b> instead of Strength. </p>
          <p> Knowledge check rolls will be used in cases of research, training, crafting, or other creative uses of
            the skill. Also, rolls may be made when there are outside stressors or risk upon failure. </p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Exceptional Success</h3>
          <p>Some abilities or checks may refer to <i>Exceptional Success</i>. Unless specified otherwise, an
            exceptional success is when you succeed at an ability or skill check by 10 or more than the DC. Not all
            checks will have results or benefits for exceptional successes, and these are separate from critical
            successes. </p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Critical Fails and Successes</h3>
          <p>When you roll a natural 1 when performing a skill check, you fail. You may suffer a Consequence from the
            GM if the risk of failure is significant but failing is usually punishment enough. </p>
          <p> Rolling a natural 20 almost always means success, but there may be some singularly difficult tasks that
            cannot be completed with a natural 20 alone. This is a rare situation and will generally be announced in
            advance of the roll by the GM. For most other skill checks, a natural 20 means you succeed and may gain a
            boon or additional bonus from doing so.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Help</h3>
          <p>You can take the <i>Help</i> action to grant advantage to an ally if you are proficient in the skill,
            tool, or another skill or tool that can feasibly be used to assist. For example, if someone is attempting
            to use Athletics to push a large boulder, your proficiency with Builder’s Tools can be the basis to help
            your ally. You may roll one of the two dice for advantage or have your ally roll both. You ally adds their
            normal bonuses to the highest die roll. </p>
          <p> When providing Help to an ally when not in turn order allows more flexibility – the character with the
            highest bonus may be the one to roll advantage and add bonuses. There may be exceptions if it is critical
            that a particular individual perform a roll. </p>
          <p> Once someone has Helped an ally on a check, it generally cannot be attempted again. </p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Teamwork</h3>
          <p>In most cases, you cannot roll multiple attempts for the same action. Instead, you can work with allies
            to make one attempt as successful as possible. </p>
          <p> Anyone with a relevant skill or ability may help you attempt something—the first person grants you
            advantage via the Help action, and every additional person grants you a +1 bonus. If the roll fails,
            however, everyone involved is liable for the consequences. </p>
          <p> Bonuses granted may differ if your allies have abilities that specify such. If an ally grants bonuses
            through these abilities, they do not give the teamwork bonus. An ally that used the Skald feat to grant
            bonuses to a skill check cannot give the teamwork bonus for that specific skill check.</p>

          <h1 class="arjulian section-title">Creating Your Character</h1>
          <p>This campaign uses homebrew rules for creating characters including unique races with greater
            customization. There are no “backgrounds” to select – instead, you may develop your own backstory, traits,
            quirks, bonds and flaws. Background features are replaced with a free feat at 1st
            level, and psionic abilities. Follow the process below and work with the GM for clarity.</p>
          <div class="ruleBox">
            <h3 class="ruleBoxTitle arjulian p-2">Creation Process in a Nutshell</h3>
            <p class="p-2">Follow these steps for character creation. Each step has further descriptions in the
              following sections.
            <ul>
              <li>Roll an Ability Score to contribute to the party array.</li>
              <li>Select your Race and take proficiencies if given.</li>
              <li>Select your Class and take proficiencies given.</li>
              <li>Select any three proficiencies instead of preset Backgrounds.</li>
              <li>All characters receive one Feat at 1st level.</li>
              <li>Spend Proficiency Points.</li>
              <li>Select one Psionic Discipline.</li>
              <li>Select your starting gear.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Ability Scores</h3>
          <p>Traditionally, players can use point buy or roll for ability scores. Surviving in the harsh environment
            of Pergasha is incredibly difficult at best and being a heroic individual impossible without a little
            extra help. </p>
          <p> The party will create an array together that the GM can adjust to be at an appropriate power level for
            the campaign. This not only avoids situations where one player feels particularly lackluster because of
            unlucky rolling but also having a player be the one-hero show. With all players sharing an array, there is
            still room for variability and customization with the additional options explained in the next sections.
          </p>
          <h4 class="arjulian">Party Array</h4>
          <p>Each player will <b>roll 4d6</b> once and drop the lowest value. The sum of the remaining 3 dice will
            contribute to a single ability score. The GM will fill in values if any are missing. These values will
            create the ability score array that all players will use towards creating characters. </p>
          <p><i>The final array is subject to GM balancing and approval.</i></p>
          <h4 class="arjulian">Score Adjustments</h4>
          <p>Players may adjust the final array by subtracting up to a max of <b>2 ability points</b> and adding them
            elsewhere. Each point may be subtracted from and added to different scores.</p>
          <!-- <h3 class="arjulian">Brightness Feature</h3>
          <p>Particularly talented individuals are thought to be blessed and are sometimes called “Brightness” or have
            the title, “of the Light.” Every player gains one and only one Brightness feature by rolling a d6 and
            referring to the following table. Alternatively, cards can be made so that there are no duplicate
            Brightness Features in a party.</p>

          <h3 class="arjulian">Races</h3>
          <p>After the Sundering and centuries of war, there was little left for the smaller races, so only
            Pergashans, Touched Kin, and Lizardfolk are available. Pergashans are descendants of giants that once
            ruled the deserts and invaded distant lands. They are the dominating culture and society and carry the
            powers of their ancestors in their blood. </p>
          <p> Touched Kin are people deformed and twisted by the inexplicable energy from the Sundering Storms that
            pass through Pergasha without warning. They can be the offspring of Pergashans, Lizardfolk, or other
            smaller races. However, they are considered their own race because Touched Kin can reproduce and pass on
            their traits to their offspring. </p>
          <p>The Lizardfolk of Pergasha are unique amongst their kind Beyond the Chasm as they have evolved to survive
            the chaotic region over millennia. They have also been affected by the Sundering just as much as the other
            races of the desert wastes. </p>
          <p>See detailed information in <a href="races.html">Races</a>.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Classes</h3>
          <p>Pergasha is a land where magic does not exist, so classes like bards, sorcerers, and wizards cannot
            function. The classes and archetypes available in this setting are listed below. For more information
            about changes to published material and homebrew content, see <a href="classes.html">Classes</a>. </p>
          <p>To add complexity to a non-magic world, you also will have access to psionic features that are beyond
            your class options. To learn more, see <a href="psionics.html">Psionics</a>.</p>
          <div class="ruleBox">
            <h3 class="arjulian p-2 ruleBoxTitle">Classes and Archetypes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Barbarian: </b>Ancestral Guardian, Battlerager, Beast, Berserker, Totem Warrior, Primeval Warrior
              </li>
              <li><b>Fighter: </b>Battle Master, Brute, Cavalier, Champion, Psi Knight, Sharpshooter, Warcaller</li>

              <li><b>Ranger: </b>Dervish, Doppelkin Master, Slayer</li>
              <li><b>Rogue: </b>Assassin, Inquisitive, Psi Assassin, Scout</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Backstory vs Background</h3>
          <p>Pergasha does not use premade Backgrounds as listed in the PHB and other published material. However,
            this does not mean your character’s background is unimportant. In fact, your backstory is critical as it
            explains who you are, how you do what you do, and where you plan to go. </p>
          <p> As you craft your backstory, decide your place in Pergasha. It is important to have driving personality
            traits, flaws, and goals as a character. Decide these for yourself or with the help of the GM. If you wish
            to use existing backgrounds to give you inspiration, you may do so, but you do not get any features or
            items from the backgrounds as written.</p>
          <p> Pergasha lacks magic, but the very air is still filled with otherworldly powers and spirits, and the
            sands hide ancient technology. Instead of background features, every character in Pergasha has a psionic
            taint, and as with all heroes, a powerful soul that attracts power to it. All characters use psionics and
            Training Points—a unique meta-currency—to access more powers as they progress, making them far more than
            your average folktale hero brandishing a sword.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Proficiencies</h3>
          <p><b>At creation, you gain 3 proficiencies to assign as you wish.</b></p>
          <p>You can customize your proficiencies in skills, tools, and languages. Proficiencies are no longer
            determined by race, class, and backgrounds, but you may gain extra proficiencies from your race and class
            selections. </p>
          <p> Regardless of your selections, all characters begin with three proficiencies and there are no
            restrictions on which you select. You can select any skill, tool, or language proficiency that makes sense
            for your character. These proficiencies are in addition to what you gain from your class selection and
            purchases via Proficiency Points (see below), which are determined by your mental ability scores.</p>
          <h4 class="arjulian">Proficiency Points</h4>
          <div class="ruleBox">
            <h5 class="ruleBoxTitle arjulian p-2">Proficiency Points at Character Creation</h5>
            <p class="text-center p-2">You gain Proficiency Points equal to: 3 + <b>half</b> the sum of your

          <p>When creating a character, you gain Proficiency Points equal to half the sum of your Intelligence,
            Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers (minimum of 0) rounded up. You also gain Proficiency Point when you get an
            Ability Score Improvement (ASI) regardless of whether you increase an ability score or take a feat. </p>
          <p> Proficiency Points can be used to purchase skill, tool, and language proficiencies in addition to feats.
            The costs are listed on the table below. </p>
          <p> You can spend your points at character creation or save them for a more expensive benefit at another
            point in time. All purchases are final and you cannot return benefits for Proficiency Points. Each time
            you level your character, you can spend any saved points.</p>

          <p> You begin with one discipline of your choice and 1 + your Intelligence modifier in Psi Points at 1st

                to carry</i>. Additional waterskins and water carried will use slots (1 full waterskin holds 5 rations
              and together they require 1 slot). </li>
            <li><b>Firestarter kit </b>includes waste patties or similar tinder and small bow to create friction (1
              slot). </li>

            <li><b>Bedroll. </b>A bedroll helps you <a href="#section8">rest properly</a> (2 slots). If you do not
              want a bedroll, you can exchange it for adventuring gear or equal or lesser barter value.</li>
            <li><b>Traveler’s clothing. </b>Clothing you wear generally does not require any slots. If you acquire

          <p> Brewing is the art of crafting fermented beverages. Not only does brewery create alcoholic beverages,
            but the process of brewing purifies water. Fermentation takes weeks to complete but only a few hours of
            work for the crafter. Pergashan economy relies almost exclusively on barter, making brewed drinks an
            important trade good. An expert brewer has the potential of crafting drinks with interesting side effects
            by using unique spices and even psi-crystals or their biproducts.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Components. </b>Brewer's supplies include a large glass jug, a quantity of hops, a siphon, and
              several feet of tubing.</li>
            <li><b>Medicine. </b>This tool proficiency grants additional insight when you treat anyone suffering from
              alcohol poisoning or when you can use alcohol to dull pain.</li>
            <li><b>Mysteriums. </b>This tool proficiency grants additional insight when trying to understand possible
              effects of certain ingestible mysteriums.</li>
            <li><b>Persuasion. </b>A stiff drink can help soften the hardest heart. Your proficiency with brewer's
              supplies can help you ply someone with drink, giving them just enough alcohol to mellow their mood.</li>
            <li><b>Create Potable Water. </b>Your knowledge of brewing enables you to purify water that would
              otherwise be undrinkable. As part of a long rest, you can purify up to 6 rations of water, or 1 ration
              as part of a short rest.</li>
            <li><b>Brew a Restorative. </b>As part of a short rest or camping activities, you turn some potable water
              into a tasty, hot drink. You use one ration of water to make 5 portions that must be enjoyed
              immediately. Everyone who drinks a fresh restorative regains 1 spent Hit Die. A creature can only
              benefit from a brewed restorative once per day.</li>

          <p> Pergasha is a land of transient nomads. Very rarely are large, permanent structures built or maintained,
            but there are some regions where people make the attempt. This kit is a combination of rudimentary
            carpentry and masonry tools. A builder can build a simple house, a shack, a wooden cabinet, or similar
            items out of wood, rough or shaped stone, and even bricks given enough time.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Components. </b>Builder’s tools include a saw, hammer with nails, hatchet, square, ruler, chisel,
              trowel, plane, and an adze.</li>
            <li><b>History. </b>This tool proficiency aids you in identifying the use and the origin of wood or stone
              buildings, structures, or large objects.</li>
            <li><b>Investigation. </b>You gain additional insight when inspecting areas within structures because you
              know tricks of construction that can conceal areas from discovery.</li>
            <li><b>Perception. </b>You can spot irregularities in hand-built walls or floors, making it easier to find
              trap doors and secret passages.</li>
            <li><b>Demolition. </b>Your knowledge of building allows you to spot weak points in hand-built walls. You
              deal double damage to such structures with your weapon attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Fortify. </b>With 1 minute of work and raw materials, you can make a door or window harder to force
              open. Increase the DC needed to open it by 5.</li>
            <li><b>Temporary Shelter. </b>While setting up camp, you can construct a lean-to or a similar shelter to
              keep your group dry and in the shade for the duration of the rest. Because it was fashioned quickly from
              whatever wood or stone was available, the shelter collapses 1d3 days after being assembled.</li>

          <p> Adventuring is a hard life. With a cook along on the journey, your meals will be much better than the
            typical mix of hardtack and dried fruit. Surprisingly, there are a number of unusual ingredients to be
            found in the desert that can grant different effects to those brave enough to eat them.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Components. </b>Cook's utensils include a metal pot, knives, forks, a stirring spoon, and a ladle.
            </li>
            <li><b>Medicine. </b>When administering treatment, you can transform medicine that is bitter or sour into
              a pleasing concoction.</li>
            <li><b>Survival. </b>When foraging for food, you can make do with ingredients you scavenge that others
              would be unable to transform into nourishing meals.</li>
            <li><b>Create Rations. </b>During a long rest, you slow-cook and preserve some fresh ingredients—usually
              meat or grains—to create 1d6 + 1 new, basic food rations that can be preserved. </li>
            <li><b>Stretch Rations. </b>While camping during a long rest, you thin out some basic rations into a
              simple meal, feeding two people for each ration you cook provided that you have sufficient food and
              supplies. If cooked successfully, everyone who eats gains 1d4 + 1 hit points. A creature can only heal
              hit points from this type of meal once per day.</li>

          <p> Leatherworkers, poisoners, exotic chefs, and healers all share a commonality: they all require the work
            of a good harvester. Quality hide, preserved poison sacs, cuts of meat from rare creatures, and important
            reagents only found on horns or in the bones of beasts come from the steady hand and labor of a harvester.
            Harvesters either go out into the world with adventurers to find these ingredients or they purchase
            carcasses, but the fresher the kill, the better the quality. A good harvester can make a fine living, and
            their work is valued by many despite its grisly nature.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Components. </b>Harvester’s tools contain a set of slender fillet and skinning knives, a bone
              cutter, tongs, gloves, vials, salt, twine, drying racks, wax coated paper, and burlap wrapping fabric.
            </li>
            <li><b>Nature. </b>You can use your knowledge of harvesting to help you identify useful components from
              creatures. You can also gauge where to find creatures that likely have components you require.</li>
            <li><b>Psionics. </b>You can use your harvesting skills to understand and find useful components from
              psionic creatures.</li>
            <li><b>Survival. </b>You can make the most of a carcass and get creative with a variety of uses.</li>
            <li><b>Harvesting. </b>You can collect useful components such as hide, bones, muscle, sinew, glands,
              teeth, claws, and organs from the body of a creature. These components make excellent barter to the
              right buyer. Example DCs are below, but depending on the creature, the condition of the carcass, and
              your work environment, these values can change. </li>

          <p><i>Artisan’s Tools</i></p>
          <p> A set of tinker's tools is designed to enable you to repair many mundane objects and understand the
            inner workings of mechanical devices. Though you cannot manufacture much with tinker's tools, you can mend
            torn clothes, sharpen a worn sword, and patch a tattered suit of chain mail. Also, you can put together
            basic mechanical devices.

          <ul>
            <li><b>Components. </b>Tinker's tools include a variety of hand tools, thread, needles, a whetstone,
              scraps of cloth and leather, and a small pot of glue.</li>
            <li><b>History. </b>You can determine the age and origin of objects, even if you have only a few pieces
              remaining from the original.</li>
            <li><b>Investigation. </b>When you inspect a damaged object, you gain knowledge of how it was damaged and
              how long ago.</li>
            <li><b>Mysteriums. </b>You can gain insight into understanding mysteriums that have moving parts or
              mechanisms.</li>
            <li><b>Repair. </b>You can restore 10 hit points to a damaged object for each hour of work. For any
              object, you need access to the raw materials required to repair it. For metal objects, you need access
              to an open flame hot enough to make the metal pliable.</li>

          <p>With the loss of magic, prevalence of telepathic communication, and mass destruction of cities and
            libraries, most people in Pergasha are illiterate. Knowledge is passed through storytelling, telepathic
            bonds, and art. It is incredibly rare to find someone who reads and writes, but they are considered wise
            and important individuals who are both protected and hunted. </p>

          <h1 class="arjulian section-title">Feats</h1>
          <p>At character creation, you receive one feat. You can also purchase feats using Proficiency Points,
            Training Points, or elect to take a feat instead of an ability score increase at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and
            19th levels. See <a href="feats.html">Feats</a> for the list of available feats in Pergasha.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-2" id="section13">
          <h1 class="arjulian section-title">Psionics</h1>
          <p>Psionics is the power of the mind over matter and reality. If the mind believes, reality is changed, and
            in Pergasha, the minds of all sentient creatures have been touched by this ability. When magic was taken
            from the desert, the psionic web strengthened, connecting the consciousness of the ancestral entities,
            spirits of nature, and the very will of the land. </p>
          <p> Practitioners of psionics understand that reality is neither fixed nor objective, but phenomenical and
            intersubjective, and that a powerful mind can battle the current consensus of reality and impose its own.
            This requires physical training and mental prowess, and in most cases, the will and intelligence needed to
            do so are rare. Something about the nature of the Sundering has given the denizens of Pergasha a measure
            of innate ability. </p>
          <p>Psionics are the powers of the awakened mind, a transcendental state of being in which awesome feats that
            defy the physical and magical rules are possible. The power of the mind alters the reality in its core,
            imposing its will to change the laws of reality and shaping it to their whims. While changing objective
            reality to subjective desires is complicated and difficult, most people in Pergasha can shift some aspect
            in their favor for brief moments. Only the most experienced mystic adepts become masters who slowly,
            painstakingly deceive reality. When they progress in their illumination, they can achieve more daunting
            effects effortlessly, shaping reality at their whim.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Boundaries</h3>
          <p>Psionics draw power directly of your conscious mind, so your mind has to be sharp and sound to use them.
            You can’t use any of your psionic powers if you have some condition that prevents you from thinking
            clearly such as charmed, frightened, incapacitated, poisoned, or stunned. Also, if you are enduring great
            physical pain, the GM may rule that you lack the mind to access your psionic abilities. Finally, you must
            expend an extra Psi Point to use an ability for each level of exhaustion you have. </p>
          <p> Nevertheless, physical bounds that normally restrict other casters, such as simple physical paralysis,
            being restrained or held in a grapple, do not impede a psionic character to use its powers. However, you
            can’t use effects that require sight if you are blinded. </p>
          <p> The nature of psionics means it is often difficult to ascertain who or what is targeting you. For this
            reason, no one gains advantage on psionic attacks for being hidden or surprising targets. </p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Mental Armor</h3>
          <p>Psionic powers often affect the physical environment and body. Some abilities, however, are direct attacks
            to the mind.
            Psionic attacks (such as Thought Bolt) target a creature’s Mental Armor Class instead of physical Armor
            Class. Your Mental AC = 10 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus. Psionic abilities that
            trigger on a weapon hit still rely on physical AC.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Psionics and Rage</h3>
          <p> If you are a Barbarian and enter Rage, you lack the mental acuity to use psionic powers that require
            concentration and finesse, and you cannot switch your psionic focus. While raging, you can activate
            abilities from disciplines that do not require concentration so long as they are from the Immortal Order.
            The physical nature of that order is compatible with the state of mind of a raging individual. Psionic
            Talents and disciplines from orders outside of the Immortal Order cannot be used while you are raging.
            However, you can maintain your rage by attacking enemies with psionic abilities within the Immortal Order.
          </p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Psi Points</h3>
          <p>You have an internal pool of mental energy that can be used to fuel effects. This energy is represented
            by Psi Points. Each psionic discipline describes several effects that you can create by spending a certain
            number of Psi Points on them. A psionic talent does not require any expenditure of Psi Points, and you can
            use them without any limit besides normal exhaustion.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Psychic Limit</h3>
          <p>Your mind, powerful as it is, isn’t omnipotent…yet. You have a hard limit in which you can warp the
            reality consensus. This limit is represented by the maximum number of Psi Points you can spend to activate
            effects of psionic disciplines in a single turn. This limit includes your action, bonus action, and
            reaction and is based on your character level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Progression Chart.
          </p>
          <p> For example, as a 3rd-level character, you can spend no more than 3 Psi Points on a discipline each time
            you use it, independently of how many Psi Points you have. If you spend 2 points to use an action, you
            have 1 point left that you may spend for a bonus action or a reaction later. Budget your points wisely.
          </p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Psychic Focus</h3>
          <p>You can focus your subconscious mind into one discipline you know to draw passive benefits from it. These
            benefits vary from discipline to discipline, and you can only focus on one discipline at a time until you
            have the Psionic Mastery feature. Your psychic focus ends when you are <i>incapacitated, frightened,
              charmed</i> or<i> stunned</i>, when you change your focus to another, or when you elect to do so. Some
            features or abilities may require for your focus to be relinquished in order to activate them. </p>
          <p> You choose your psychic focus when you finish a long rest and may shift it later as an action. You can
            only shift your focus once per short rest, to a maximum of three shifts each day.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Psionic Mastery</h3>
          <p>At 11th level, your mastery over your psionic energy allows you to push your mind beyond its normal
            limits. Choose a discipline you know. All the benefits of its psychic focus are permanent to you and don’t
            count against your psychic focus limit. This enables you to choose another discipline you know to have as
            your psychic focus and still gain its benefits. </p>
          <p>You also gain that discipline’s Mastery effects, described in each discipline. You must be able to afford
            the Psi Point cost if there is one. As normal, a Mastery focus still ends when you are <i>incapacitated,
              frightened, charmed</i> or<i> stunned</i>. </p>
          <p> You gain a second Mastery when you reach the 20th level. When you reach 17th level, you gain the Mastery
            Improvement feature which removes the Concentration tag on any effects of your Mastery discipline, if
            applicable.</p>
          <h3 class="arjulian">Psionic Disciplines and Talents</h3>
          <p>Psionic talents and disciplines are the heart of a mystic’s craft. They are the mental exercises and
            psionic formulae used to forge will into tangible effects. </p>
          <p> Psionic disciplines were each discovered by different orders and tend to reflect their creators’
            specialties. You can learn any discipline regardless of its associated order although you will benefit
            from using disciplines from orders that align with your base class and its primary ability score.</p>
          <p> Psionics draw power directly of your conscious mind, so your mind has to be sharp and sound to use them.
            You can’t use any of your psionic disciplines or talents if you have some condition that alters your mind
            such as <i>charmed, frightened, incapacitated, poisoned</i> or<i> stunned</i>. Being under mental stress,
            such as with a temporary madness, can also weirdly interact with your psionics, provoking strange effects,
            and for each Exhaustion level you have, your Talent’s Psi Points cost increases by 1. </p>
          <p>See <a href="psionics.html">Psionics</a> for a detailled list of Disciplines and Talents.</p>
          <h4 class="arjulian">Using a Discipline</h4>
          <p>Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it and all contained in its description. The
            discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you
            must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.
          </p>
          <p> The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline. </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Psychic Focus</h5>
          <p>The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline
            for your psychic focus. You can only have one focus active at a time, but a focus does not require
            concentration as other discipline effects may.</p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Power Options and Psi Points</h5>
          <p>A discipline provides different powers to activate with your Psi Points. Each power has a name, and the
            Psi Point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of Psi
            Points to use that option while abiding by your psi limit. If you don’t have enough Psi Points left, or
            the cost is above your Psi limit, you can’t use the option. </p>
          <p> Some options show a range of Psi Points rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend
            a number of points within that range while still abiding by your Psi limit. Some options let you spend
            additional Psi Points to increase an effect’s potency. Again, you must abide by your Psi limit, and you
            must spend all the points when you first use the discipline; you can’t decide to spend additional points
            once you see the discipline in action. </p>
          <p> Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its
            range. </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Components</h5>
          <p>Disciplines don’t require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken
            words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind. </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Duration</h5>
          <p>An effect option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts. </p>
          <p><b>Instantaneous. </b>If no duration is specified, the effect of the option is instantaneous.</p>
          <p><b>Concentration. </b>Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is
            noted with “conc.” after the option’s psi point cost. The “conc.” notation is followed by the maximum
            duration of the concentration. For example, if an option says “conc., 1 min.,” you can concentrate on its
            effect for up to 1 minute. Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a
            spell. This rule means you can’t concentrate on two disciplines at the same time. (See chapter 10,
            “Spellcasting,” in the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for how concentration works.)</p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Targets and Areas of Effect</h5>
          <p>Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect, as
            presented in chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i>. </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Saving Throws and Attack Rolls</h5>
          <p>If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or
            failed saving throw. The DC for any ability is 8 + your proficiency modifier + the modifier to the
            applicable ability score. </p>
          <p> Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline’s effect hits
            its target. The attack roll uses the ability determined by the discipline’s order.
            The discipline’s category determines which ability score is applicable. When more than one ability score
            is listed, you select which score you will use.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Avatar: </b>Charisma or Intelligence</li>
            <li><b>Awakened: </b>Intelligence</li>
            <li><b>Far Hand: </b>Dexterity or Intelligence</li>
            <li><b>Immortal: </b>Strength or Constitution</li>
            <li><b>Nomad: </b>Intelligence or Wisdom </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Combining Psionic Effects</h5>
          <p>The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of the disciplines overlap.
            Likewise, different options from a psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time.
            However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn’t combine with itself if the option is used
            multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect—usually dependent on how many Psi Points were used to
            create the effect— applies while the durations of the effects overlap.</p>
          <h4 class="arjulian">Using a Talent</h4>
          <p>Psionic talents are minor abilities that require psionic aptitude but don’t drain your reservoir of
            psionic power. Talents are similar to disciplines and use the same rules, but with three important
            exceptions:
          <ul>
            <li>You can never use your psychic focus on a talent.</li>
            <li>Talents don’t require you to spend Psi Points to use them.</li>
            <li>Talents aren’t linked to Mystic Orders.</li>
          </ul>
          The DC for any talent is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Intelligence modifier.
          </p>
          <h5 class="arjulian">Burn</h5>
          <p>Another key feature of a psionic talent is the ability to overcharge it, enabling a burst of power
            unavailable through
            other means. This feature is called Burn, and each talent has its burn listed at the end of its description.
          </p>

          <p>A burn uses the same action economy associated with the talent unless specified otherwise. Once you burn a
            talent, you
            cannot use that specific talent until you take a full rest.</p>

          <p>In addition, you must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 15) or suffer one level of Fatigue. If
            a specific
            burn has additional side effects, it will be listed in its description. If a talent lists more than one burn
            option, you
            must pick which ability you activate.</p>

          <p>You can burn any talent you have, but each talent can only be burned once before needing to be recharged
            with a full
            rest. Also, the DC for the Intelligence saving throw to avoid Fatigue increases by 2 for each burn you take
            after the
            first.</p>

          <h4 class="arjulian">Fatigue</h4>
          <p>Fatigue represents mental weariness similar to how exhaustion effects the body. Psionics is a mentally
            taxing power
            that, if mismanaged, can can cause the mind and body to break down. Some abilities, features, or effects may
            add levels
            of fatigue, demonstrating mental exertion.</p>
          <p>Fatigue is similar to exhaustion in that each level gained has different effects, and all effects are
            cumulative. Refer
            to the Fatigue Effects table at the end of this section for more information.</p>
          <p>Recovering from fatigue requires mindful resting. Meditating while taking a long rest will remove one level
            of fatigue.
            Taking a full rest will remove two levels of fatigue. Some abilities or items may also remove fatigue.</p>

          <p>This occurs when a psionic mind shatters from exertion. A powerful burst of energy explodes from the
            individual, dealing
            1d10 psychic damage per character level to all other creatures within a 30-foot radius before rendering the
            individual
            unconscious.</p>
