                                    <strong>Pureblooded</strong> Pergashans are unmarred by the Sundering
                                    and environment. Their blood runs purple like their titan
                                    ancestors, and they are respected amongst the Tribes.
                                    Pergashans prefer to marry purebloods in the attempt to
                                    preserve their people, an endeavor that becomes more
                                    and more difficult with each generation.

                                    <strong>Twisted</strong> Pergashans have been physically and/or mentally
                                    altered by the chaotic energy of the Sundering Storms,
                                    mana, or other oddities of Pergasha. Bearing this taint has
                                    a slight stigma within Pergashan society as these are seen
                                    as signs of weakness or impurity. This view is not entirely
                                    without merit as twisted individuals have nearly black
                                    blood with an iridescent sheen.

                                    <strong>Paragon of the Gem Tribe.</strong> Little is known of the gem titans, but
                                    your body is suffused with their alien power. You can sacrifice
                                    your lifeforce to harvest psi-crystals from your body. These
                                    crystals can store Psi points, push limits, or intensify your psionic
                                    powers in exchange for reducing your maximum hit point total
                                    by a certain degree.
                                    </br></br>
                                    The cost of creating these crystals is based on the highest value
                                    of your Hit Dice. For example, if your highest Hit Die is a d8, your
                                    cost to create a Blue storage crystal will begin at 8 with a
                                    maximum cost of 24 hit points. You cannot reduce this cost in
                                    any way, and the only way to recover your lifeforce is to
                                    reabsorbing the crystals during a long rest. No other ability will
                                    recover your maximum hit points lost in this way.
                                    </br></br>
                                    Harvesting a psi-crystal is done during a full rest as the process is
                                    exhausting and delicate. See the table below for costs and
                                    effects of the different psi-crystals you can harvest.

                                    You create a blue storage crystal that can hold a number of psi
                                    points equal to your Intelligence modifier. For each cost you
                                    pay, you can increase the storage capacity by your
                                    Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Only a Gem Pergashan can
                                    store psi into a crystal by expending their own Psi points during
                                    a short or long rest, but any creature can use the energy freely.
                                    A creature holding this crystal can use its reserves to pay the Psi
                                    point cost of abilities. The creature must still follow their Psi limit.
                                    When a crystal is depleted, it is an empty psi husk that can be recharged again.

                                    The DC for all psionic abilities increases by 1. A creature can
                                    benefit from multiple purple crystals, but they must wear and
                                    attune to them to utilize this ability.

                            rest. Once you use the activation ability of a song, you cannot
                            use that song again in such a way until you take a short or long rest.

                            powerful silk. Once per long rest, you can shoot out a thick,
                            sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The web
                            fills a 20-foot cube from that point for up to 1 hour. For each
                            category size above Small, the size of the area increases by 5
                            feet (Medium has a 25-foot cube, Large has a 30-foot cube,
                            and so on). The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure the
                            area. You are not affected by webbing of any kind.

                            Each creature of Large or smaller size that starts its turn in the

                            saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as
                            long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. If the
                            creature is larger than Huge, the web is destroyed by the
                            creature’s movements.

                            A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make

                            restrained. Your DC is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your

                            The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed

                            creature that starts its turn in the fire.

                            Alternatively, you may expel the webs harmlessly and use
                            them as a material. The silk webbing is a valuable resource that
                            can be used in building and crafting. You expel the equivalent
                            of 1 square yard of silk worth 1 uncommon barter.

                            wings. At 1st level, they are useable, but your twisted nature
                            makes it impossible to fly for long periods. The wings require
                            conditioning and patience to fully master. Once per short rest,
                            you can fly for 1 minute at the same rate as your walking
                            speed. You cannot be encumbered or exhausted to use this
                            ability. If you fall unconscious or have your movement reduced
                            to 0 while flying, you plummet to the ground, and while flying you must move at least half
                            your speed to stay aloft. You can always glide from a height easily, preventing you from
                            taking falling damage so long as you are conscious and
                            unencumbered. Finally, you can use a bonus action to Dash
                            while flying.

                            Your wings improve when you reach certain levels: at 5th you
                            can fly for 1 hour once per short rest; at 11th you can fly up to 8
                            hours once per long rest; at 17th you gain a flight speed equal
                            to your walking speed as you have fully adapted and
                            strengthened your wings.

                                    and often become tribe leaders. Pureblooded lizardfolk

                                    Pergasha. These changes often carry a stigma among
                                    Lizardfolk as a mark of weakness or impurity (hence the
                                    derogatory term twisted). This stigma is similar to how
                                    some Pergashans view Touched Kin or their own twisted
                                    people. Some Lizardfolk sprout extra limbs, acquire
                                    enhanced mental powers, or gain a primal connection to
                                    these environmental energies.

                            fills a 20-foot cube from that point for up to 1 hour. For each

                            and so on). The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure the

                            Each creature of Large or smaller size that starts its turn in the

                            saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as
                            long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. If the
                            creature is larger than Huge, the web is destroyed by the

                            A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make
                            a Strength check against your DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer
                            restrained. Your DC is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your

                            silk. Once per long rest, you can shoot out a thick, sticky webbing at a point of your
                            choice within range. The web fills a 20-foot cube from that point for up to 1 hour. The
                            webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure the area. Each creature of Large or
                            smaller size that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must
                            make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as
                            it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. If the creature is larger than Huge, the
                            web is destroyed by the creature’s movements. A creature restrained by the webs can use
                            its action to make a Strength check against your DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer
                            restrained. Your DC is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier. The webs
                            are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing
                            2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;
                            Alternatively, you may expel the webs harmlessly and use them as a material. The silk
                            webbing is a valuable resource that can be used in building and crafting. You expel the
                            equivalent of 1 square yard of silk worth 1 uncommon barter.
