                                <b><i>Spider’s Web.</i> </b>Your twisted anatomy enables you to spin useful and powerful
                                silk. Once per long rest, you can shoot out a thick, sticky webbing at a point of your
                                choice within range. The web fills a 20-foot cube from that point for up to 1 hour. The
                                webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure the area. Each creature of Large or
                                smaller size that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must
                                make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as
                                it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. If the creature is larger than Huge, the
                                web is destroyed by the creature’s movements. A creature restrained by the webs can use
                                its action to make a Strength check against your DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer
                                restrained. Your DC is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier. The webs
                                are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing
                                2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;
                                Alternatively, you may expel the webs harmlessly and use them as a material. The silk
                                webbing is a valuable resource that can be used in building and crafting. You expel the
                                equivalent of 1 square yard of silk worth 1 uncommon barter.

                                hits, it deals its normal damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your twice
                                your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). Additionally, for the next minute, you may
                                add your proficiency modifier to any weapon damage you deal to this creature. <br>&nbsp;

                                beyond normal for the day, this ability only fulfills your base needs.
