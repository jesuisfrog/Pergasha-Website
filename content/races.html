                            choice, you cannot change it. </br>

                                    <strong>Pureblooded</strong> Pergashans are unmarred by the Sundering
                                    and environment. Their blood runs purple like their titan
                                    ancestors, and they are respected amongst the Tribes.
                                    Pergashans prefer to marry purebloods in the attempt to
                                    preserve their people, an endeavor that becomes more
                                    and more difficult with each generation.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Twisted</strong> Pergashans have been physically and/or mentally
                                    altered by the chaotic energy of the Sundering Storms,
                                    mana, or other oddities of Pergasha. Bearing this taint has
                                    a slight stigma within Pergashan society as these are seen
                                    as signs of weakness or impurity. This view is not entirely
                                    without merit as twisted individuals have nearly black
                                    blood with an iridescent sheen.

                                    your allies. You may use an action and expend 1 Hit Die to heal
                                    up to your Intelligence modifier of allies (including yourself)
                                    within 30 feet of you that you can see. Roll 1 Hit Die + your

                                    your body that it is weightless. As an action, you can levitate up
                                    to 20 feet from a solid surface and remain there with
                                    concentration. You can only move by pushing or pulling
                                    against a surface or fixed object, but you can end your

                                    <strong>Paragon of the Gem Tribe.</strong>Little is known of the gem titans, but
                                    your body is suffused with their alien power. You can sacrifice
                                    your lifeforce to harvest psi-crystals from your body. These
                                    crystals can store Psi points, push limits, or intensify your psionic
                                    powers in exchange for reducing your maximum hit point total
                                    by a certain degree.
                                    </br></br>
                                    The cost of creating these crystals is based on the highest value
                                    of your Hit Dice. For example, if your highest Hit Die is a d8, your
                                    cost to create a Blue storage crystal will begin at 8 with a
                                    maximum cost of 24 hit points. You cannot reduce this cost in
                                    any way, and the only way to recover your lifeforce is to
                                    reabsorbing the crystals during a long rest. No other ability will
                                    recover your maximum hit points lost in this way.
                                    </br></br>
                                    Harvesting a psi-crystal is done during a full rest as the process is
                                    exhausting and delicate. See the table below for costs and
                                    effects of the different psi-crystals you can harvest.

                                    <strong>Blue (Storage)</strong> - <i>Cost: 1+</i>

                                    You create a blue storage crystal that can hold a number of psi
                                    points equal to your Intelligence modifier. For each cost you
                                    pay, you can increase the storage capacity by your
                                    Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Only a Gem Pergashan can
                                    store psi into a crystal by expending their own Psi points during
                                    a short or long rest, but any creature can use the energy freely.
                                    A creature holding this crystal can use its reserves to pay the Psi
                                    point cost of abilities. The creature must still follow their Psi limit.
                                    When a crystal is depleted, it is an empty psi husk that can be recharged again.

                                    The DC for all psionic abilities increases by 1. A creature can
                                    benefit from multiple purple crystals, but they must wear and
                                    attune to them to utilize this ability.

                                    Finally, you can use a Gem tribe heritage feature requiring the

                                    derrogatory term twisted). This stigma is similar to how

                                    these environmental energies.

                            silk. Once per long rest, you can shoot out a thick, sticky webbing at a point of your
                            choice within range. The web fills a 20-foot cube from that point for up to 1 hour. The
                            webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure the area. Each creature of Large or
                            smaller size that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must
                            make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as
                            it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. If the creature is larger than Huge, the
                            web is destroyed by the creature’s movements. A creature restrained by the webs can use
                            its action to make a Strength check against your DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer
                            restrained. Your DC is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier. The webs
                            are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing
                            2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;
                            Alternatively, you may expel the webs harmlessly and use them as a material. The silk
                            webbing is a valuable resource that can be used in building and crafting. You expel the
                            equivalent of 1 square yard of silk worth 1 uncommon barter.
